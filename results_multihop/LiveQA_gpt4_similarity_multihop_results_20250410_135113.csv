Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect various parts of the body, and it is characterized by distinctive facial features, short stature, heart defects, and other health issues. While Noonan syndrome itself is not directly associated with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), there are some reports and studies that suggest a potential link between the two conditions.

1. **Genetic Overlap**: Some studies have indicated that certain genetic mutations associated with Noonan syndrome may also be found in patients with renal anomalies, including cystic kidney diseases. This could suggest a shared genetic pathway or predisposition.

2. **Case Reports**: There are case reports in the medical literature that describe patients with both Noonan syndrome and renal cysts or other kidney abnormalities. These cases can provide insight into the potential co-occurrence of these conditions.

3. **Clinical Observations**: Clinicians have noted that patients with Noonan syndrome may have a higher incidence of renal anomalies, although the exact relationship and prevalence are still being studied.

For specific references, you may want to look into genetic studies, case reports, and reviews in medical journals that focus on genetic syndromes and renal diseases. Journals such as ""American Journal of Medical Genetics"" or ""Pediatric Nephrology"" may have relevant articles. Additionally, databases like PubMed can be useful for finding research articles that discuss the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney disease.","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"Physician: A positive VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test indicates that you may have been exposed to syphilis, but it is important to confirm this with additional testing, as false positives can occur. Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Follow-Up Testing**: Schedule a follow-up appointment for more specific tests, such as the RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) or a treponemal test, to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.

2. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: It's essential to discuss your results with a healthcare provider who can guide you through the next steps and provide appropriate treatment if necessary.

3. **Inform Sexual Partners**: If you are diagnosed with syphilis, inform any recent sexual partners so they can also get tested and treated if needed.

4. **Practice Safe Sex**: Until you have been treated and cleared, use condoms or dental dams to reduce the risk of transmitting the infection.

5. **Monitor Symptoms**: Be aware of any symptoms such as sores, rashes, or flu-like symptoms, and report these to your healthcare provider.

6. **Regular Check-Ups**: If you are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), consider regular screenings as part of your healthcare routine.

Taking these precautions can help manage your health and prevent the spread of syphilis.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The effects of anesthesia on patients with Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) can vary depending on individual health factors and the specific type of anesthesia used. Generally, anesthesia is considered safe for patients undergoing surgery, including hip replacement, but there are some important considerations for FXTAS patients.

1. **Neurological Considerations**: FXTAS can affect the nervous system, and patients may have unique responses to anesthesia. It's essential to inform the anesthesiologist about the patient's condition so they can tailor the anesthesia plan accordingly.

2. **Monitoring**: Patients with FXTAS may require closer monitoring during and after the procedure due to potential complications related to their condition.

3. **Postoperative Recovery**: FXTAS patients may experience longer recovery times or different side effects from anesthesia, so it's important to have a plan in place for postoperative care.

4. **Consultation**: It is advisable for the patient to have a thorough discussion with both their surgeon and anesthesiologist before the operation to address any concerns and ensure that all precautions are taken.

In summary, while anesthesia is generally safe, FXTAS patients should be carefully evaluated and monitored to minimize any risks. Always consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, your daughter should definitely discuss her symptoms with her doctor right away. Ocella, like other hormonal birth control methods, can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially in certain individuals. The symptoms she is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, swelling in her thigh, and large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could indicate a serious condition. It's important for her to seek medical attention promptly to evaluate her symptoms and determine the best course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing UTI issues. Since you have a penicillin allergy and are also allergic to dairy, it's important to find an alternative antibiotic that is safe for you. Here are a few options that your doctor might consider:

1. **Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid)** - This is often used for uncomplicated UTIs and is generally well-tolerated.
2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)** - This is another common option, but make sure to check for any sulfa allergies.
3. **Fosfomycin (Monurol)** - This is a single-dose treatment that can be effective for UTIs.
4. **Cefdinir or Cefpodoxime** - These are cephalosporins that may be suitable, but confirm with your doctor due to your penicillin allergy.

Make sure to discuss your allergies and previous treatment failures with your doctor, as they can help determine the best course of action for your situation. Additionally, if you have recurrent UTIs, it might be worth discussing preventive measures or further evaluation.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Yes, a streptococcus infection can lead to complications that may resemble or trigger conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis (now known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis). While streptococcus itself does not directly cause Wegener's, infections can sometimes initiate an autoimmune response or exacerbate underlying conditions. It's important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.
					* GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.The cause of GPA is unknown. GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.. Wegener's granulomatosis triggered by infection?

					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or ""group A strep."" This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is
					external).

					Severe Strep Infections

					Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) - To learn more visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention necrotizing fasciitis site (link is external).
					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","While the exact causes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are not fully understood, several risk factors have been identified. Smoking is a well-known risk factor for AMD, and there is evidence suggesting that secondhand smoke may also contribute to the development of the disease. 

Given your history of exposure to secondhand smoke in a work environment, it is possible that this could have played a role in your diagnosis of early AMD. Other factors, such as age, genetics, and overall health, also contribute to the risk of developing AMD. Since you mentioned that your genetic profile does not include any previous conditions, it may be worth discussing with your healthcare provider how your work environment and lifestyle factors could have influenced your eye health. 

It's important to continue monitoring your condition and follow any recommendations from your eye care professional to manage your AMD effectively.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","A molar pregnancy, also known as gestational trophoblastic disease, occurs when there is an abnormal growth of trophoblastic cells, which normally develop into the placenta during a normal pregnancy. In a molar pregnancy, conception is indeed a requirement, as it begins with the fertilization of an egg. However, the fertilization process can lead to abnormal genetic material, resulting in the formation of a molar pregnancy rather than a viable embryo. 

There are two types of molar pregnancies: complete and partial. In a complete molar pregnancy, an egg with no genetic material is fertilized by a sperm, leading to the growth of abnormal tissue. In a partial molar pregnancy, an egg is fertilized by two sperm or by one sperm that duplicates its genetic material, resulting in some normal placental tissue along with abnormal tissue.

If you have further questions or concerns about molar pregnancies, please feel free to ask.","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to consider that your symptoms could be related to a condition like HNPP (Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies) rather than arthritis, especially if you've had ongoing issues with swelling, soreness, and stiffness in your hands and feet. HNPP can sometimes present with symptoms that overlap with those of arthritis, such as pain and discomfort in the extremities. 

However, diagnosing these conditions can be complex, as they can share similar symptoms. It's important to have a thorough evaluation, including a detailed medical history and possibly genetic testing for HNPP, to clarify the diagnosis. If HNPP is confirmed, it may explain your symptoms and could lead to different management strategies compared to arthritis. I recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider, who can help determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."
"vasculitis. 
				Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis
				Our doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help
				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","I'm sorry to hear about your wife's condition. Giant cell vasculitis, also known as temporal arteritis, can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly. The symptoms you're describing, such as vomiting something resembling coffee grounds, swelling in her feet and legs, migraines, and facial swelling, are concerning and may indicate complications related to the condition or its treatment.

It's crucial that you contact her healthcare provider immediately to discuss these symptoms, as they may require urgent evaluation. In particular, the vomiting could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a serious issue. The swelling and migraines could also indicate other underlying problems that need to be addressed.

Please ensure that she receives the appropriate medical attention as soon as possible. If her symptoms worsen or if she experiences severe pain, confusion, or difficulty breathing, seek emergency care right away.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.. GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"Physician: It's understandable to have questions about the genetic aspects of Fibromyalgia, especially with your diagnosis and the findings from your blood work. While Fibromyalgia itself is not classified as a purely genetic condition, there may be genetic factors that contribute to its development. To explore this further, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Genetic Counseling**: Consider meeting with a genetic counselor who can help you understand the implications of your missing chromosome and how it might relate to your symptoms. They can also guide you on whether genetic testing is appropriate.

2. **Genetic Testing**: If indicated, genetic testing can help identify any specific genetic markers associated with Fibromyalgia or related conditions. Your healthcare provider can refer you to a specialist who can conduct these tests.

3. **Family History**: Discuss your family history with your physician. If other family members have similar symptoms or conditions, it may provide insight into a potential genetic link.

4. **Research Studies**: Look into ongoing research studies on Fibromyalgia. Some studies focus on the genetic components of the condition, and participating in such research could provide more information.

5. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest research on Fibromyalgia and genetics. New findings are emerging that may shed light on the condition's underlying causes.

Feel free to ask any more questions or express any concerns you may have about this process.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

While it can help in some cases, it may also cause irritation or damage to the ear canal or eardrum if not used properly. It's essential to ensure that you don't have any existing ear conditions, such as a perforated eardrum or an ear infection, before using peroxide. Additionally, flushing with warm water should be done gently to avoid any injury. If you experience pain, discomfort, or if the earwax buildup persists, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for safe removal.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit.

Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","Sevoflurane, like many anesthetic agents, has specific stability considerations once opened. Generally, once the bottle is opened, it is recommended to use the product within a certain timeframe to ensure its effectiveness and safety. The expiration date listed on the bottle typically applies to unopened containers. 

For opened bottles, the stability can vary based on storage conditions, exposure to light, and contamination. Many manufacturers suggest using opened bottles within a few months, but it's essential to refer to the specific product's guidelines or the manufacturer's recommendations for the most accurate information. Always ensure that the product is stored properly and check for any signs of degradation before use. If in doubt, consult your pharmacy or the manufacturer's guidelines for the best practices regarding the use of Sevoflurane after opening.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride).

"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral disorder typically diagnosed in children and adolescents. It is characterized by a pattern of angry, irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. Children with ODD may frequently lose their temper, argue with authority figures, actively refuse to comply with requests, and deliberately annoy others. 

The exact cause of ODD is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Treatment often involves therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help the child develop better coping strategies and improve their behavior. Parent training programs can also be beneficial in managing the child's behavior at home.

If you have specific questions or concerns about ODD, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).

Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by overgrowth and an increased risk of certain tumors. It is typically caused by abnormalities in the genes located on chromosome 11, particularly those involved in growth regulation. Here are some key features and information about BWS:

1. **Symptoms**: Individuals with BWS may exhibit a variety of symptoms, including:
   - Macrosomia (larger than average size at birth)
   - Macroglossia (enlarged tongue)
   - Omphalocele (a defect in the abdominal wall)
   - Hemihyperplasia (asymmetrical growth of one side of the body)
   - Ear creases or pits
   - Increased risk of tumors, particularly Wilms tumor (a type of kidney cancer) and hepatoblastoma (liver cancer).

2. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is often made based on clinical features, family history, and genetic testing. Genetic testing can identify specific changes in the genes associated with BWS.

3. **Management**: Management of BWS typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including regular monitoring for growth and development, screening for tumors, and addressing any specific health concerns that arise. Surgical interventions may be necessary for certain physical anomalies.

4. **Prognosis**: The prognosis for individuals with BWS varies. While many children with the syndrome lead healthy lives, they require ongoing medical care and monitoring due to the associated risks.

5. **Genetic Counseling**: Families affected by BWS may benefit from genetic counseling to understand the inheritance patterns, risks for future pregnancies, and implications for family members.

If you have specific questions or areas of interest regarding Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have a genetic component, but it is not solely determined by genetics. Certain types of dementia, such as early-onset Alzheimer's disease, can be linked to specific genetic mutations that may be inherited. However, most cases of dementia, particularly late-onset Alzheimer's, are influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. This means that while having a family history of dementia may increase your risk, it does not guarantee that you will develop the condition. Anyone can potentially develop dementia, regardless of their genetic background.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease

Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options for sleep apnea, especially for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP therapy. The type of surgery recommended often depends on the specific cause of the sleep apnea. Common surgical procedures include:

1. **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**: This surgery removes excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway.
2. **Genioglossus advancement**: This procedure repositions the tongue muscle attachment to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway.
3. **Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA)**: This surgery moves the upper and lower jaw forward to enlarge the airway.
4. **Bariatric surgery**: In some cases, weight loss surgery may be an option if obesity is a contributing factor.

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"It's understandable to be worried after such an incident. However, the risk of HIV transmission in this scenario is very low. HIV is primarily transmitted through specific bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, and it requires direct access to the bloodstream or mucous membranes. 

In your case, since you washed the blood off your skin after 15 minutes, the risk of transmission is significantly reduced. Additionally, HIV does not survive long outside the human body, and the likelihood of transmission from blood that is not fresh is very low.

If you are still concerned, it may be a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and possibly get tested for peace of mind. They can provide you with more personalized advice and support.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."

congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition that occurs when there is a defect in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity and potentially affecting lung development. The exact causes of CDH are not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 

Cousin marriage can increase the risk of genetic disorders, including congenital conditions like CDH, due to the higher likelihood of inheriting recessive genetic traits. However, it is not a direct cause of CDH.

As for lung disease, babies with CDH may experience various respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs), and increased susceptibility to infections. Long-term outcomes can vary significantly depending on the severity of the hernia and the effectiveness of treatment. Some children may have ongoing respiratory challenges, while others may have normal lung function as they grow. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential to monitor and manage any potential lung issues.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","If someone in the workplace has shingles, especially in a food handling environment, it's important to take certain precautions. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which can be contagious to those who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Contagiousness**: Shingles is not spread through casual contact, but the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with the rash. If the rash is covered, the risk of transmission is lower.

2. **Food Handling**: If the person with shingles has a rash, they should avoid direct contact with food and food preparation areas until the rash has crusted over. This typically takes about 7 to 10 days after the rash appears.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: Good hygiene practices should be followed, including frequent handwashing and using gloves when handling food, especially if there is any risk of contact with the rash.

4. **Workplace Policies**: It may be beneficial for the workplace to have policies in place regarding illness and food safety to protect both employees and customers.

5. **Consulting Health Authorities**: If there are concerns about the risk of transmission in the workplace, it may be helpful to consult with local health authorities or a workplace health professional for guidance.

If you have further questions or need specific advice, please let me know!","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
			. My question to you is: what is the reason that there is very little attentions is to Antiphosoholipid Syndrome? To find the causes and possibly some type of cure for us who struggle with this auto-immune blood disorder? I guess that since it is female directed (9-1 female to male) that
				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","Physician: Thank you for your question and for sharing your perspective. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is indeed a complex autoimmune disorder that has historically received less attention compared to other conditions, which can be attributed to several factors. 

Firstly, the prevalence of APS is relatively low, and while it can have serious consequences, it may not be as widely recognized as other autoimmune diseases that affect a larger population. Additionally, the fact that APS predominantly affects women may contribute to a perception that it is less urgent or important, despite the significant impact it has on those who suffer from it, including men like yourself.

Research funding and attention often follow public awareness and advocacy, and since APS is less known, it may not attract as much research investment. However, there are ongoing efforts to increase awareness and understanding of APS, and researchers are actively working to uncover its causes and potential treatments.

Your voice and experiences are important in advocating for more research and attention to APS. Engaging with support groups, raising awareness, and participating in clinical trials can also help drive progress in understanding and treating this condition. If you have specific concerns or symptoms, I encourage you to discuss them with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and support.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is recommended to be taken in the evening because the body produces most of its cholesterol at night. Taking it in the evening can enhance the medication's effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels. While taking it in the morning may not cause harm, it might not be as effective in managing cholesterol levels compared to taking it in the evening. If you have any concerns or experience side effects, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."
"Prednisone	. My husband has been on Prednisone for almost a year for a Cancer treatment he had. He started at 30mg and stayed on 10mg until a couple weeks ago. The prednisone was causing other side effects. He reduced down to 5mg for a couple days and now has been off the prednisone for a week. How
				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","It's important to note that prednisone can stay in the system for a while, but its effects may diminish after stopping the medication. Generally, prednisone has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours, but it can take several days for the body to fully clear it, especially after long-term use. 

The symptoms your husband is experiencing, such as chills, fever, and abdominal pain, can occur when tapering off prednisone, particularly if he was on it for an extended period. These symptoms may be related to withdrawal or the underlying condition being treated. It's also possible that his body is adjusting to the absence of the medication.

It's crucial to monitor these symptoms closely. If they persist or worsen, or if he experiences severe discomfort, it's advisable to contact his healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. They may want to assess whether these symptoms are part of the withdrawal process or if there is another underlying issue that needs to be addressed.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug. If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your
					body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual
					symptoms while you are taking decreasing doses of prednisone or after you stop taking the medication."

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics
			. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',
				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great to hear that you're looking to stay active despite your asthma. Exercise can indeed be beneficial, but it's important to choose activities that are safe and manageable for you. Here are some recommendations for exercises that are generally well-tolerated by individuals with asthma:

1. **Walking**: Start with short, easy walks and gradually increase the duration as you feel more comfortable. Walking indoors, such as in a mall, can help avoid triggers like cold air.

2. **Swimming**: This is often recommended for asthmatics because the warm, humid air can be easier to breathe. Plus, the buoyancy of water reduces strain on your body.

3. **Cycling**: Stationary cycling can be a good option, as it allows you to control your environment and intensity. Outdoor cycling can be done in moderate weather to avoid triggers.

4. **Yoga**: This can help improve your breathing techniques and reduce stress, which may help manage asthma symptoms.

5. **Low-Impact Aerobics**: Activities that keep your heart rate up without putting too much strain on your lungs can be beneficial. Look for classes designed for beginners or those with respiratory issues.

6. **Strength Training**: Light to moderate weight training can be effective. Focus on exercises that don’t require holding your breath or straining too hard.

Before starting any new exercise program, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider. They can help you develop a personalized plan that considers your asthma triggers and overall health. Additionally, always have your rescue inhaler on hand during exercise, and pay attention to your body’s signals. If you experience any difficulty breathing, stop and rest. 

Remember, the goal is to find activities that you enjoy and can do consistently while managing your asthma effectively.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey. Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

					The trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...
					One recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...
					One study found that people who practiced Hatha yoga two-and-a-half hours a week for 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. The same benefit would probably result from Tai Chi, a martial art that also emphasizes breathing, says Dr. Graham. ..."

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"A bundle branch block is a condition that occurs when there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to the heart's ventricles. This can affect how the heart beats and can be identified on an electrocardiogram (ECG).

**Symptoms:**
Many people with bundle branch block may not experience any symptoms. However, some may have symptoms such as:
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain (in some cases)

**Management:**
The treatment for bundle branch block depends on the underlying cause and whether the patient is experiencing symptoms. Options may include:
- Monitoring: If there are no symptoms, regular monitoring may be all that's needed.
- Treating underlying conditions: If the block is due to heart disease or other conditions, treating those may help.
- Medications: In some cases, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying heart conditions.
- Pacemaker: If the bundle branch block is causing significant symptoms or if there is a risk of more serious heart rhythm problems, a pacemaker may be recommended to help regulate the heart's electrical signals.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice regarding medications.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Physician: Yes, arrhythmia can occur after an ablation procedure, although it is often a temporary situation as the heart heals. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but it generally ranges from 70% to 90%. Your heart rate fluctuations from 254 to 21 are concerning and indicate significant variability in your heart rhythm. It's important to discuss these findings in detail, as they may require further evaluation and management. Let's review your Holter test results and consider the best course of action for your situation.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil citrate, which is the same active ingredient found in Viagra. Both medications are used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis, helping to achieve and maintain an erection when sexually stimulated.

Here are some key points to consider regarding Fildena:

1. **Effectiveness**: Since Fildena contains the same active ingredient as Viagra, it may have similar effectiveness in treating ED. However, individual responses can vary.

2. **Dosage**: Fildena comes in various dosages, so it's important to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare provider to determine the right amount for you.

3. **Side Effects**: Like Viagra, Fildena can cause side effects, including headaches, flushing, nasal congestion, and digestive issues. Serious side effects are rare but can include changes in vision or hearing, and priapism (a prolonged erection).

4. **FDA Approval**: As you mentioned, Fildena is not FDA-approved. This means it has not undergone the same rigorous testing and evaluation as Viagra. Therefore, there may be concerns regarding its safety, efficacy, and quality control.

5. **Availability**: Fildena is often available online and may be marketed as a cheaper alternative to Viagra. However, purchasing medications from unregulated sources can pose risks.

6. **Consultation**: It's crucial to discuss with your healthcare provider before starting Fildena or any new medication, especially since it is not FDA-approved. They can provide guidance based on your health history and needs.

If you're looking for alternatives to Viagra, your physician may also suggest other FDA-approved medications for ED, such as Cialis (tadalafil) or Levitra (vardenafil), which may be covered by your insurance.","Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications
					Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you
					to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.. Fildena contains Sildenafil Citrate, a common ingredient used in various leading branded ED pills like kamagra etc. and which are available over the counter. Sildenafil Citrate was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharma. Sildenafil
					Citrate helps treat erectile dysfunction (trouble having an erection). Helps a man have an erection or have a better erection with his penis during sex. It also treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in both men and women.

					Fildena is the latest ED pill launched by Fortune Healthcare which has more than two decade's experience in producing ED pills. Fildena has the same trust and guarantee of millions of worldwide patients who have earlier used other ED pills like Filagra, Filitra and Tadalista all manufactured by

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While naltrexone is primarily known as an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid addiction and alcohol dependence, some studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that low doses may have potential benefits for various conditions, including mood disorders.

However, it's important to note that the evidence supporting the use of LDN for severe depression is still limited and not yet widely accepted in clinical practice. If you're considering this treatment option, I recommend discussing it with a mental health professional who can provide guidance based on the latest research and your specific situation. Additionally, you can search for relevant clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov to find studies that may be exploring this treatment further.","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be caused by several different viruses, the most common being hepatitis A, B, and C. Here’s how each type is typically transmitted:

1. **Hepatitis A**: This virus is usually spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or through close contact with an infected person. It is often associated with poor sanitation and hygiene practices.

2. **Hepatitis B**: This virus is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, or vaginal secretions. Common ways of transmission include unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth.

3. **Hepatitis C**: This virus is primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact. This can occur through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs, receiving contaminated blood products, or less commonly, through sexual contact.

It's important to practice good hygiene, get vaccinated where applicable (like for hepatitis A and B), and take precautions to avoid sharing needles or engaging in unprotected sex to reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis. If you have any specific concerns or risk factors, please let me know!","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other
					injection drug equipment
					* Needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or tinea cruris, typically presents with symptoms such as itching, redness, and a rash in the groin area. Small lumps under the skin around the scrotum are not a common symptom of jock itch. These lumps could be due to various other conditions, such as cysts, folliculitis, or other skin issues. It's important to have any new or unusual lumps evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and whether treatment is necessary. If you're experiencing discomfort or have concerns, I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

Some patients may have a normal temperature, especially in the early stages of the condition. Other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite, are also important indicators. If you suspect appendicitis, it's essential to seek medical attention for a proper evaluation.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main

Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to evaluate each medication's effects and potential interactions. 

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: Taking diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can potentially reduce the effectiveness of lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure. Additionally, NSAIDs can increase the risk of kidney problems, especially in patients taking blood pressure medications.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and Aleve are NSAIDs, and taking them together can increase the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and kidney damage. It is generally not recommended to take two NSAIDs simultaneously.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: Acetaminophen is not an NSAID and does not have the same interactions with lisinopril. However, it is important to monitor the total dosage of acetaminophen to avoid liver damage.

In summary, it is advisable to consult with your healthcare provider before combining these medications to ensure safety and effectiveness based on your individual health needs.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

					Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL
					BLEEDING, ULCERATION, PERFORATION and DRUG INTERACTIONS). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in ""over the counter"" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia..

"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a genetic disorder that typically leads to severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities. The condition is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 13. Unfortunately, the prognosis for individuals with trisomy 13 is generally poor, and many affected infants do not survive past their first year of life. For those who do survive, the severity of symptoms can vary, but many experience worsening health issues over time, including complications related to heart defects, kidney problems, and other organ dysfunctions.

Diagnosis of trisomy 13 can be made through several methods, including:

1. **Prenatal Testing**: This can include non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or amniocentesis, which can detect chromosomal abnormalities before birth.

2. **Postnatal Testing**: After birth, a karyotype analysis can be performed on a blood sample to confirm the presence of an extra chromosome 13.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

					The evidence is current to October 2014."
"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For treating mite infestations in humans, particularly with a focus on non-toxic options or those with minimal side effects, here are some recommended approaches:

### Treatment:
1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: While it is a synthetic chemical, it is often considered safe for topical use. It is effective against scabies mites and has minimal side effects for most people.
   - **Sulfur Ointment**: This is a natural treatment that can be effective against mites. It is generally well-tolerated but may have a strong odor.

2. **Oral Medications**: 
   - **Ivermectin**: This is an oral medication that can be effective for severe cases of scabies. It is generally safe but should be used under medical supervision.

3. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Tea Tree Oil**: Known for its antimicrobial properties, diluted tea tree oil may help in reducing mite populations. Always perform a patch test first to check for skin sensitivity.
   - **Neem Oil**: This natural oil has insecticidal properties and can be applied topically. It is generally safe but should be used with caution.

### Prevention:
1. **Hygiene Practices**: 
   - Regularly wash bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water to eliminate any mites.
   - Vacuum carpets and upholstery frequently to remove any potential mite habitats.

2. **Avoid Close Contact**: 
   - Limit close contact with individuals who are infested until they have been treated.

3. **Environmental Control**: 
   - Use air purifiers and dehumidifiers to reduce humidity levels, as mites thrive in humid environments.

4. **Regular Skin Care**: 
   - Keep skin clean and moisturized to maintain a healthy barrier against infestations.

Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any treatment to ensure it is appropriate for your specific situation.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."
meds taken with wine at dinnertime. Is it safe to take my meds with wine at dinnertime?,"It's important to be cautious when mixing medications with alcohol, including wine. Some medications can interact negatively with alcohol, potentially reducing their effectiveness or causing harmful side effects. It's best to consult your prescribing physician or pharmacist about your specific medications to determine if it's safe to consume wine while taking them. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and the medications you are taking.","Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can
					make it dangerous to drive, and when you mix alcohol with certain medicines you put yourself at even greater risk. Combining alcohol with some medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries, especially among older people."

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur for several reasons, including:

1. **Prematurity**: Premature infants may not have fully developed the ability to regulate their blood sugar levels.
2. **Low birth weight**: Infants with low birth weight may have less glycogen stores and be more susceptible to low blood sugar.
3. **Maternal diabetes**: Babies born to mothers with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia after birth due to high insulin levels.
4. **Inadequate feeding**: If a newborn does not feed adequately, they may not receive enough glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels.
5. **Infections or illnesses**: Certain medical conditions can affect a newborn's ability to maintain stable blood sugar levels.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Manage diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, it is crucial to manage blood sugar levels effectively during pregnancy.
2. **Regular prenatal care**: Attend all prenatal appointments to monitor the health of both the mother and the baby.
3. **Balanced diet**: Maintain a healthy and balanced diet during pregnancy, ensuring adequate intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
4. **Monitor fetal growth**: Regular ultrasounds and assessments can help ensure the baby is growing appropriately.
5. **Educate on feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed promptly and adequately, especially within the first few hours of life.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, a CT scan can detect diverticulosis and diverticulitis even if there is no active infection at the time. Diverticulosis refers to the presence of diverticula (small pouches) in the colon, which can be identified on a CT scan. If diverticulitis occurs, the scan can show signs of inflammation or complications associated with the diverticula. However, if there is no infection, the scan may primarily reveal the diverticula themselves without signs of inflammation.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by colds while others are not can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Immune System Strength**: Individuals with a stronger immune system are better equipped to fight off viruses, including those that cause colds. Factors such as nutrition, sleep, and overall health can influence immune function.

2. **Genetics**: Some people may have genetic predispositions that make them more or less susceptible to certain viruses.

3. **Exposure**: People who are frequently exposed to cold viruses, such as those in crowded environments or with close contact to infected individuals, are more likely to catch a cold.

4. **Stress Levels**: Chronic stress can weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to infections.

5. **Age**: Children and older adults may have weaker immune responses compared to healthy adults, making them more vulnerable to colds.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Habits such as smoking, lack of exercise, and poor diet can negatively impact immune health, increasing the likelihood of getting sick.

Understanding these factors can help in taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of catching a cold.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg- 1 daily. Doctor prescribed for type 2 diabetes w/Metformin 500 mg 2 times daily. Pharmacy refused to fill stating overdose of Metformin. Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"In this situation, the pharmacy is correct in refusing to fill the prescription as it appears to be an overdose of Metformin. The maximum recommended daily dosage of Metformin for adults is typically 2000 mg to 2500 mg, depending on the specific formulation and the patient's needs. 

In the case of Janumet XR, which combines Sitagliptin and Metformin, the maximum dosage of Metformin in Janumet XR is 2000 mg per day. Since the patient is already taking Metformin 500 mg twice daily (totaling 1000 mg), the additional 1000 mg from Janumet XR would exceed the recommended maximum dosage. 

It would be advisable for the physician to review the patient's medication regimen and adjust the prescriptions accordingly to ensure safety and compliance with dosing guidelines.",The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets are 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).
SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Yes, Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but serious neurological condition that can occur as a complication of measles infection. It typically develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, and while it is most commonly seen in children, it can occur in older individuals as well, including adults who did not receive the measles vaccination. Since your son is 33 years old and did not have the measles vaccination, he is at risk for measles infection, and consequently, SSPE could potentially occur in the future if he contracts measles. It is important to discuss vaccination options and preventive measures with a healthcare provider.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","It's understandable that you're seeking information about Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) for your granddaughter. KTS is a rare vascular disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including abnormal growth of blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones, often affecting one limb more than the other.

To find current research and treatments available for KTS, I recommend visiting ClinicalTrials.gov, which is a comprehensive database of clinical studies conducted around the world. You can search for ""Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome"" to find ongoing or completed trials that may provide insights into new treatments or therapies.

In addition to clinical trials, it's important to consult with a pediatric specialist who has experience with KTS. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your granddaughter's specific symptoms and needs. Treatment options may include physical therapy, pain management, and, in some cases, surgical interventions to address complications.

Please ensure that you keep an open line of communication with your healthcare provider to discuss any findings from your research and to explore the best options for your granddaughter's care.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."

Please call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room right away. Do not wait for symptoms to appear, as iron overdose can be very serious and requires prompt treatment. If possible, bring the container of the iron pills with you to help the medical team.","Iron is a mineral found in many over-the-counter supplements. Iron overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this mineral. This can be by accident or on purpose.

Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"To provide an accurate response, I need to clarify a few points about inherited ricketts. If the mother has inherited ricketts, it is important to understand the genetic pattern of inheritance for this condition. 

If the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, there is a 50% chance that each child (A or B) will inherit the condition from the affected parent. If B child does not have the condition, they would not pass it on to their children. 

If the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, both parents must carry the gene for a child to be affected. If B child is not affected but is a carrier, there is a chance they could pass the gene to their children, depending on the genetic status of the other parent.

In summary, if B child does not have the condition and is not a carrier, they will not pass it on. If they are a carrier, the likelihood of passing it on would depend on the genetic status of their partner. It would be beneficial for B child to undergo genetic counseling for a clearer understanding of their specific situation.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."
"Medicare Part B coverage. I suffer with acute fibromyalgia (sp?) and the various drugs my doctor has prescribed for me have little if any effect in helping to control the pain.

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR A1298C variant is a genetic mutation that can affect the body's ability to process folate and regulate homocysteine levels. Homozygous individuals (those with two copies of the A1298C variant) may have an increased risk for certain health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and complications during pregnancy. 

However, the impact of this mutation can vary widely among individuals. Some may experience significant health issues, while others may not have any noticeable problems. It's important to consider other factors such as lifestyle, diet, and overall health.

In terms of long-term prognosis, individuals with the homozygous A1298C variant should focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet rich in folate (found in leafy greens, legumes, and fortified foods), regular exercise, and routine medical check-ups to monitor homocysteine levels and overall health.

If you have specific health concerns or symptoms, it would be beneficial to discuss them with a healthcare provider who can offer personalized advice and management strategies.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can lead to various side effects, including gastrointestinal issues like flatulence. While Vitamin D is essential for health, excessive intake can result in toxicity, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and more serious complications like hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood).

For individuals with very low levels of Vitamin D, high doses may be prescribed temporarily to raise those levels effectively. However, it's crucial to do this under medical supervision, as the appropriate dosage can vary based on individual health needs, current Vitamin D levels, and other factors. Regular monitoring of Vitamin D levels and calcium levels is recommended to ensure safety and effectiveness. Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting or adjusting any supplement regimen.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To help prevent a shingles outbreak, there are several strategies you can consider:

1. **Vaccination**: The shingles vaccine (Shingrix) is highly effective in reducing the risk of developing shingles and its complications. It is recommended for adults aged 50 and older, even if you've had shingles before.

2. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Maintaining a healthy immune system can help reduce the risk of shingles. This includes eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and managing stress.

3. **Avoiding Triggers**: Some people find that certain factors can trigger a shingles outbreak, such as stress, illness, or injury. Identifying and managing these triggers can be beneficial.

4. **Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider can help monitor your health and address any concerns that may increase your risk of shingles.

5. **Good Hygiene Practices**: Keeping your skin clean and avoiding contact with anyone who has chickenpox or shingles can help prevent the virus from reactivating.

If you have specific concerns or conditions that may affect your risk, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.","How Can You Reduce Your Risk of Getting Shingles?
					Vaccination is the only way to reduce your risk of shingles and PHN. CDC recommends adults age 60 years or older receive a single dose of shingles vaccine. Zostavax'ae is the only shingles vaccine currently available. It is available by prescription from a healthcare professional. Talk with your doctor or

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and its potential implications, especially with your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While I can't provide specific statistics without more context, I can share some general information.

Thyroid tumors can vary widely in their behavior. The majority of thyroid nodules are benign, but the risk of malignancy increases with certain factors, such as size, characteristics on imaging, and patient history. Tumors greater than 1 cm are often monitored closely, and your endocrinologist will likely use ultrasound and possibly fine-needle aspiration biopsy to assess the tumor's nature.

In general, the risk of thyroid cancer in nodules larger than 1 cm is estimated to be around 5-15%, depending on various factors. However, many of these tumors are still benign. It's important to continue regular monitoring and follow your endocrinologist's recommendations.

If you have specific concerns or symptoms, please discuss them with your healthcare provider, as they can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the
					development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival over the 4
					decades of study."
diabete. whats diabete,"Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. There are two main types of diabetes: 

1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the body does not produce insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. It usually develops in children and young adults.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is more common and typically develops in adults. In this type, the body either becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. It is often associated with obesity and lifestyle factors.

Managing diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar levels, following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and sometimes taking medication or insulin. If you have more specific questions about diabetes, feel free to ask!","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."

1. **Consult Your Physician**: Before making any changes to your medication, discuss your desire to taper off with your doctor. They can provide a personalized tapering schedule based on your specific situation.

2. **Gradual Reduction**: Your doctor may suggest gradually reducing your dose. This could involve decreasing the dosage incrementally over a period of weeks or months, depending on how long you've been taking the medication and your response to it.

3. **Monitor Symptoms**: As you taper off, keep track of any withdrawal symptoms or the return of depression or anxiety symptoms. This information can help your doctor adjust your tapering plan if necessary.

4. **Support**: Consider seeking support from a therapist or support group during this process, as it can be challenging to stop taking an antidepressant.

5. **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Incorporate healthy lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques, to help support your mental health during the tapering process.

Always follow your physician's advice and never stop or adjust your medication without their guidance.","1. he tapered off bupropion SR, taking 150 mg/day for 4 days followed by 150 mg every other day for 8 days (4 total doses) and 150 mg every third day for 6 days (2 total doses) without further complications.

Both minerals play important roles in bone health, and having a balance between them can be beneficial, especially for conditions like osteoporosis. The Kirkland brand of calcium you purchased, which includes vitamin D, is generally a good choice, as vitamin D helps with calcium absorption. However, it's important to ensure you're getting the right dosage and balance of these nutrients. I recommend discussing your specific needs and any potential interactions with your healthcare provider to create a plan that's tailored to your health situation.","1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal.

Chronic cervicitis, even if not caused by a sexually transmitted infection, can potentially impact fertility, particularly if it leads to scarring or changes in the cervical tissue. The inflammation itself may not directly cause infertility, but it can create an environment that affects sperm passage or increases the risk of complications during pregnancy.

As for tampons, they can sometimes cause irritation or introduce bacteria, which may lead to inflammation if not used properly. It's important to ensure that tampons are changed regularly and that proper hygiene is maintained.

"trisomy 7. trisomy 7. i am a 32 y/o who has had 4 miscarriages in the past 19 months. Upon my last DNC two weeks ago revealed a genetics study diagnosis of the baby having trisomy 7. could you offer me any information on this? could this have been maternal or paternal? is this something i would be
				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Trisomy 7 is a genetic condition where there is an extra copy of chromosome 7 in the cells. This can lead to various developmental issues, but it is important to note that trisomy 7 is not typically viable for a full-term pregnancy, which is likely why you experienced miscarriages.

Regarding the origin of the extra chromosome, it can occur due to errors during cell division, specifically during meiosis, which is the process that creates sperm and eggs. This means that it can be either maternal or paternal in origin, but it is often random and not necessarily inherited from either parent. 

As for whether you could be a carrier, trisomy 7 is usually not associated with a carrier state like some other genetic conditions. It is generally considered a sporadic event rather than something that would indicate a genetic predisposition in the parents.

The causes of trisomy can include advanced maternal age, but in many cases, it occurs without any identifiable risk factors. If you have concerns about your reproductive health or the risk of future pregnancies, it may be beneficial to consult with a genetic counselor who can provide more personalized information and support.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."

intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine can have several effects on digestion and absorption in the intestines. Here are some general effects:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine can constrict blood vessels, which may reduce blood flow to the digestive organs. This can impair the function of the intestines and affect nutrient absorption.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can disrupt the normal motility of the gastrointestinal tract. It may lead to increased gastric acid secretion and can affect the movement of food through the intestines, potentially causing issues like constipation or diarrhea.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may influence the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and other glands, which can affect the breakdown and absorption of nutrients.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smokers are at a higher risk for conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and inflammatory bowel disease, all of which can negatively impact digestion and absorption.

5. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can change the composition of gut bacteria, which plays a crucial role in digestion and nutrient absorption. An imbalance in gut microbiota can lead to digestive issues and malabsorption.

6. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Due to the effects on digestion and absorption, smokers may be at risk for certain nutrient deficiencies, including vitamins and minerals that are essential for overall health.

Overall, smoking and nicotine can significantly disrupt the digestive process and nutrient absorption, leading to various gastrointestinal issues and health concerns.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about this situation. Cancer itself is not contagious and cannot spread through blood contact in the way that infectious diseases can. However, if your uncle has an active infection or if there are any other health concerns, it's important to take precautions. I recommend that you clean the area thoroughly and monitor for any signs of infection. If you have any symptoms or further concerns, please consult a healthcare professional for advice.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities. Activities that put excessive stress on the plantar fascia, such as running, standing for long periods, or walking on hard surfaces, can lead to increased pain and inflammation. 

Other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper arch support or cushioning can exacerbate the condition.
2. **Overuse**: Increasing the intensity or duration of physical activities too quickly can lead to flare-ups.
3. **Obesity**: Excess body weight can put additional strain on the plantar fascia.
4. **Tight Muscles**: Tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon can contribute to increased tension on the plantar fascia.
5. **Foot Structure**: Flat feet or high arches can also predispose individuals to plantar fasciitis.

It's important to address these factors to help manage and alleviate symptoms. If you have further questions or need specific recommendations, feel free to ask!","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can sometimes be detected during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) examination, such as an endoscopy or imaging studies like a CT scan. However, these procedures are primarily focused on the upper GI tract, so while they may reveal abnormalities in the lymph nodes or liver, further tests may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. If there are concerns about lymph nodes or liver cancer, additional imaging or biopsies may be recommended for a more accurate assessment.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					anemia
					gastroesophageal reflux disease
					ulcers
					cancer
					inflammation, or swelling
					precancerous abnormalities
					celiac disease

					2. Tests for Liver Cancer

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"Yes, an abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious health complications, including an increased risk of heart problems. The infection from an abscess can enter the bloodstream and may contribute to conditions such as endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart's inner lining. This can increase the risk of heart attack or other cardiovascular issues. It's important to address dental infections promptly to prevent these complications. If you have an abscessed tooth, I recommend seeking treatment as soon as possible.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Ischemic syncope refers to a temporary loss of consciousness due to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, often caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke. In this context, a stroke is a medical condition where there is an interruption of blood supply to the brain, leading to brain cell damage. Ischemic strokes are caused by blockages in the blood vessels supplying the brain, often due to blood clots. In summary, ischemic syncope can be a symptom or result of underlying cerebrovascular issues, such as a stroke or TIA, where the brain does not receive adequate blood flow, leading to fainting or loss of consciousness.","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Autoimmune illness. What doctor specializes in testing for and treatment of autoimmune illness?,"A physician who specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune illnesses is typically a rheumatologist. Rheumatologists focus on autoimmune diseases that affect the joints, muscles, and connective tissues. Depending on the specific autoimmune condition, other specialists such as endocrinologists (for autoimmune thyroid diseases), dermatologists (for skin-related autoimmune issues), or gastroenterologists (for autoimmune conditions affecting the digestive system) may also be involved in your care. It's important to consult with your primary care physician to get a referral to the appropriate specialist.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any
					specialty may encounter patients with autoimmune disease."
"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is an antidepressant that can cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect in some patients. The exact mechanism by which Effexor causes ED is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine, which can influence sexual function.

As for the minimum amount that might cause ED, it can vary significantly from person to person. Some individuals may experience side effects at lower doses, while others may tolerate higher doses without issues. There isn't a specific minimum dose established that guarantees the absence of ED, as individual responses to medication can differ widely.

If you're concerned about this side effect, it's important to discuss it with your physician. They can help assess your situation and may consider adjusting your dosage or exploring alternative treatments if necessary.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have been implicated in erectile dysfunction (ED) for several years, although the exact duration of this association is not precisely defined. Research has suggested that long-term use of NSAIDs may affect erectile function due to their impact on blood flow and hormonal levels. While some studies have indicated a potential link, the evidence is not universally conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship. If you have concerns about NSAID use and ED, it may be beneficial to discuss alternative pain management options with your healthcare provider.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve in the heart becomes narrowed, which can restrict blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. This narrowing can occur due to age-related calcification, congenital heart defects, or rheumatic fever. 

Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include:

- Shortness of breath, especially during exertion
- Chest pain or tightness
- Fatigue, particularly during physical activity
- Dizziness or fainting spells

Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination, listening for a characteristic heart murmur, and imaging tests such as echocardiograms. Treatment options depend on the severity of the condition and may include monitoring, medication, or surgical procedures like valve repair or replacement.

If you have specific questions or concerns about aortic stenosis, feel free to ask!","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"White blood cell (WBC) count can increase due to various factors, including:

1. **Infections**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can trigger an increase in white blood cells as the body responds to fight off the pathogens.

2. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases or allergies, can lead to elevated white blood cell counts.

3. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can temporarily raise white blood cell levels.

4. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, can stimulate the production of white blood cells.

5. **Bone marrow disorders**: Conditions like leukemia or other bone marrow diseases can cause an abnormal increase in white blood cells.

6. **Tissue damage**: Trauma, burns, or surgery can lead to an increase in white blood cells as the body responds to injury.

7. **Chronic diseases**: Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic kidney disease can also result in elevated white blood cell counts.

If you have specific concerns or symptoms, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
					Chronic myelogenous leukemia
					Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine
					Infections, bacterial or viral
					Myelofibrosis
					Polycythemia vera
					Rheumatoid arthritis
					Smoking
					Stress, such as severe emotional or physical stress
					Tuberculosis
					Whooping cough"
