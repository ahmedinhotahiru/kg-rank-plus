Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"There are a few references that connect Noonan Syndrome with Polycystic Kidney Diseases:

1. **Noonan Syndrome-Like Disorder with or without Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia**: This is a condition that has a relationship with Polycystic Kidney Diseases, indicating some overlap in genetic or phenotypic characteristics.

2. **Kidney Manifestations**: Both Noonan Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Diseases involve kidney-related issues. Noonan Syndrome has been mapped to kidney conditions, suggesting that individuals with Noonan Syndrome may also experience renal complications.

These connections highlight the potential for shared genetic pathways or clinical features between Noonan Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Diseases, although they are distinct disorders. If you have further questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"Physician: A positive VDRL test indicates that you may have syphilis, a contagious venereal disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Follow-Up Testing**: It's important to confirm the diagnosis with more specific tests, such as treponemal tests, to determine if you have syphilis. False positives can occur with the VDRL test.

2. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: Schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your condition, discuss your symptoms, and recommend appropriate treatment.

3. **Treatment**: If diagnosed with syphilis, treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as penicillin. It's crucial to follow the treatment plan as prescribed.

4. **Inform Sexual Partners**: Notify any recent sexual partners so they can also get tested and treated if necessary.

5. **Practice Safe Sex**: Until you have been treated and cleared by a healthcare provider, it's important to practice safe sex to prevent transmission.

6. **Regular Check-Ups**: After treatment, follow up with your healthcare provider to ensure the infection has been cleared and to monitor for any potential complications.

Remember, early diagnosis and treatment are key to managing syphilis effectively. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The effects of anesthesia on patients with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) can vary based on individual health factors and the specifics of the procedure. Generally, anesthesia is used to ensure that patients do not experience pain during surgery, such as a hip replacement. 

However, FXTAS is characterized by neurological symptoms, including intention tremor and ataxia, which may complicate anesthesia management. It is essential for the anesthesiologist to be aware of the patient's FXTAS diagnosis, as this may influence the choice of anesthetic agents and techniques used during the procedure.

While anesthesia itself is not typically harmful to the brain, patients with FXTAS may have unique sensitivities or risks associated with anesthesia due to their underlying neurological condition. Therefore, it is crucial to have a thorough preoperative assessment and to discuss any concerns with the surgical and anesthesia teams. They can tailor the anesthesia plan to minimize risks and ensure the patient's safety during the hip replacement surgery. 

In summary, while anesthesia is necessary for pain management during surgery, careful consideration and planning are required for FXTAS patients to ensure a safe and effective anesthetic experience.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, Ocella, which contains drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, is a type of hormonal birth control that can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms your daughter is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, and swelling in her thigh, along with large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could be indicative of DVT or other complications. Given that these symptoms have worsened after giving birth, it is crucial that she discusses this with her doctor as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is important to assess her condition and determine the appropriate course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","Given your history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and your allergies to penicillin and dairy products, it’s important to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective against the bacteria causing your infections. Here are a few options that you can discuss with your doctor:

1. **Nitrofurantoin**: This is often used for uncomplicated UTIs and may be a good option if you haven't tried it before.

2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)**: This combination antibiotic is effective for many types of UTIs, but make sure to check for any potential allergies or interactions.

3. **Fosfomycin**: This is a single-dose antibiotic that can be effective for uncomplicated UTIs and may be worth discussing with your doctor.

4. **Cefdinir or Cefixime**: These are cephalosporin antibiotics that are generally well-tolerated and can be alternatives if you are not allergic to them.

5. **Aztreonam**: This is a monobactam antibiotic that is often safe for patients with penicillin allergies.

Make sure to inform your doctor about your allergies and any previous antibiotic treatments you've had. They may also consider doing a urine culture to identify the specific bacteria causing your infection and determine the most effective antibiotic. Additionally, if you have recurrent UTIs, discussing preventive measures or a longer course of antibiotics may also be beneficial.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Streptococcal infections primarily involve bacteria of the genus Streptococcus and can lead to various diseases, but they are not typically associated with causing granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multisystemic disease characterized by inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and is often associated with specific autoantibodies.

While streptococcal infections can lead to complications such as rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, they do not directly cause the symptoms or the underlying pathology of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, infections can sometimes trigger autoimmune responses in susceptible individuals, which may lead to symptoms that overlap with those of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but this is not a direct causative relationship. 

If you have concerns about symptoms that may resemble those of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, it is important to discuss them with a healthcare provider for appropriate evaluation and management.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.
					* GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.The cause of GPA is unknown. GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.. Wegener's granulomatosis triggered by infection?
					Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease of unknown origin, although recent studies suggest that auto-immune mechanisms and infection play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. During follow-up, nasal carriage of Staphyloccocus Aureus could be documented. An overview of Wegener's
					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or ""group A strep."" This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is

					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

					Fever and chills

"Diabetes and pain control. 
				How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.","To narrow your search for information regarding pain (joint) medication suitable for a person with Type 2 diabetes, consider the following steps:

1. **Focus on Pain Management Guidelines**: Look for guidelines specifically addressing pain management in patients with diabetes. This will help you identify medications that are safe and effective for individuals with this condition.

2. **Search for Non-NSAID Options**: Since some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can affect kidney function, which may be a concern for diabetic patients, consider searching for alternative pain relief options such as acetaminophen or certain topical analgesics.

3. **Explore Diabetes-Safe Medications**: Investigate medications that are known to be safe for diabetic patients. For example, certain classes of medications like SGLT2 inhibitors may have dual benefits for managing both diabetes and pain.

4. **Consult Pain Management Resources**: Utilize resources that specialize in pain management for chronic conditions. This may include interdisciplinary approaches that consider both diabetes and pain management.

5. **Review Clinical Studies**: Look for clinical studies or reviews that specifically address the efficacy and safety of pain medications in diabetic patients, particularly those with joint pain.

6. **Consider Patient History**: Take into account any other health conditions or medications the patient may be taking, as this can influence the choice of pain management strategies.

By focusing on these areas, you can find relevant information that will help in selecting appropriate pain management options for a patient with Type 2 diabetes.","Diabetes and Sick Days: What Meds are OK

"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Physician: Thank you for sharing your history. While your diagnosis of early Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is concerning, it's important to note that several factors can contribute to the development of AMD, including age, genetics, and environmental exposures. 

Regarding your question about secondhand smoke, research has suggested that exposure to tobacco smoke, even as a non-smoker, can have detrimental effects on eye health. Passive smoking has been associated with various health issues, and there is some evidence to suggest that it may increase the risk of developing AMD. The conditions you described at your workplace, with poor ventilation and exposure to secondhand smoke, could potentially have contributed to your AMD diagnosis.

It's also worth considering that being Caucasian is a known risk factor for AMD, as this condition tends to be more prevalent in individuals of European descent. While we cannot definitively say that secondhand smoke was the sole cause of your AMD, it may have played a role in conjunction with other risk factors. 

I recommend discussing your concerns further with your eye care specialist, who can provide more personalized insights and management options for your condition.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Yes, conception is a requirement for a molar pregnancy. A hydatidiform mole, which is a type of molar pregnancy, occurs as a result of fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon, leading to the formation of a zygote. This process of conception typically occurs at the very beginning of a pregnancy, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. In the case of a molar pregnancy, the fertilization process leads to abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue, resulting in the characteristics associated with hydatidiform moles, such as swelling of the chorionic villi and elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about the symptoms you're experiencing, especially since they can overlap between conditions like hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and arthritis. HNPP can cause issues such as pain, tingling, and weakness in the hands, which might be mistaken for arthritis, particularly if there is swelling and stiffness involved. 

In your case, the history of multiple surgeries on your hands and ongoing symptoms could suggest that the underlying issue might be related to nerve compression or damage rather than just arthritis. It's important to consider the results of your son's tests for HNPP, as this condition can have a hereditary component. 

If HNPP is confirmed, it may explain some of your symptoms as well. I recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your symptoms in the context of both conditions and possibly suggest further testing or treatment options tailored to your specific situation.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."
"vasculitis. 
				Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis
				Our doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help
				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","It sounds like your wife is experiencing some concerning symptoms related to her diagnosis of giant cell vasculitis. The coffee ground vomiting you mentioned is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates the presence of coagulated blood in her vomit, which can be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. This symptom, along with the swelling in her feet and legs, migraines, and facial swelling, suggests that she may be experiencing significant complications related to her condition.

Given the seriousness of these symptoms, it is crucial that she receives immediate medical attention. I recommend contacting her healthcare provider or going to the emergency room to ensure she is evaluated thoroughly. They may need to perform diagnostic tests to determine the cause of her symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

In the meantime, keep track of any other symptoms she may experience, as this information can be helpful for her medical team. Please ensure she stays hydrated and comfortable until she can be seen by a doctor.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.. GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

					Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis."
can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"To determine if you have a genetic form of Fibromyalgia, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Genetic Testing**: Consult with a genetic counselor or a specialist who can guide you through the process of genetic testing. They can analyze your DNA to look for specific genetic alterations that may be associated with Fibromyalgia or other related conditions.

2. **Family History**: Discuss your family history with your healthcare provider. If there are other family members with Fibromyalgia or similar chronic pain conditions, this information may be relevant for genetic considerations.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in chronic pain can help assess your symptoms and any potential genetic links. They may also consider other factors that could contribute to your condition.

4. **Research and Resources**: Look for reputable research studies or resources that focus on the genetic aspects of Fibromyalgia. Some organizations may offer information on ongoing studies that you could participate in.

5. **Follow-Up**: After genetic testing, ensure you have a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and their implications for your health and treatment options.

By taking these steps, you can gain a better understanding of whether there is a genetic component to your Fibromyalgia and chronic pain.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"It's important to discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your healthcare provider. While you have been using the estradiol patch for 4.5 months, the decision to stop should be based on your individual health needs and circumstances. Hormone replacement therapy, including the use of estradiol patches, is typically tailored to each patient. Please consult with your primary care provider to evaluate your situation and determine the best course of action.","Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system

"Ear Wax.. 
				I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Using hydrogen peroxide in the ear can be effective for softening earwax, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind. 

1. **Concentration**: Ensure that you are using a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide, typically around 3%. Higher concentrations can be irritating to the ear canal.

2. **Bubbling Action**: The bubbling action of hydrogen peroxide can help to break down earwax, but it may also cause discomfort or a sensation of fullness in the ear.

3. **Flushing**: After using hydrogen peroxide, flushing the ear with warm water can help remove loosened wax. However, be cautious not to use too much force, as this can damage the ear canal or eardrum.

4. **Existing Conditions**: If you have any existing ear conditions, such as a perforated eardrum, ear infections, or a history of ear surgery, it's best to avoid using hydrogen peroxide and consult a healthcare professional.

5. **Frequency**: Regular use of hydrogen peroxide for earwax removal is not generally recommended. If you find that you need to do this frequently, it may be worth discussing with a physician to explore other options for earwax management.

If you experience any pain, discomfort, or changes in hearing after using hydrogen peroxide, you should seek medical advice.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most
					effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment."
"Sevoflurane. 
				I work in a hospital, and a question recently came up regarding the stability of Sevoflurane once it has been opened. Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","Physician: Sevoflurane, like many medical products, has a specific expiration date assigned by the manufacturer. This date indicates the time until which the product is guaranteed to retain its properties and effectiveness when stored properly. However, once the bottle is opened, the stability of Sevoflurane may be affected by factors such as exposure to air and contamination. 

It's important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding the use of Sevoflurane after opening. Typically, there may be a recommended timeframe for using the product after it has been opened, which could be shorter than the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend checking the product's specific instructions or consulting with your pharmacy department for the best practices regarding the stability and usage of Sevoflurane after it has been opened.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride). In rats, this emulsion was an effective anesthetic and was not associated with adverse events. The emulsion was stable after consecutive evaluation for 365 days and for 180
					minutes after the vial was opened.. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium

"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral condition that typically develops in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedient, negative, and agitated behavior, often directed towards authority figures. Children with ODD may exhibit a quarrelsome attitude and may be vengeful, but unlike those with conduct disorder, their behaviors do not usually involve aggression, destruction, theft, or deceit.

ODD can co-occur with other disorders, such as Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It's important to recognize that while ODD involves defiance and opposition, it does not typically include the more severe behaviors seen in conduct disorder.

If you have specific questions about symptoms, treatment options, or how ODD may affect daily life, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical abnormalities and growth-related issues. The primary features of this syndrome include:

1. **Umbilical Hernia**: A condition where part of the intestine protrudes through the abdominal wall near the belly button.
2. **Macroglossia**: An enlarged tongue, which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.
3. **Gigantism**: Excessive growth, often leading to larger-than-average body size or specific body parts.

In addition to these primary characteristics, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome may also experience secondary features such as:

- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of internal organs.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous if not managed properly.
- **Ear Abnormalities**: Various ear-related issues may also be present.

BWS is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, meaning it is part of a group of syndromes that can lead to excessive growth and may be associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies. The genetic basis of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is often linked to abnormalities in specific genes, such as the **H19 gene** and mutations in the **CDKN1C gene**.

The syndrome can manifest in various ways, including prominent eyes and generalized overgrowth. It is important for individuals with BWS to receive regular medical evaluations to monitor for potential complications, including the risk of tumors.

If you have specific questions about the management, treatment options, or genetic counseling related to Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."
"CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.. 
				CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.
				Does ciprofaxin work well? Is there a better drug if so what.","Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacterial infections, including those caused by Citrobacter freundii. However, the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin can be influenced by the presence of antibiotic resistance, which is a common issue with many bacteria, including Citrobacter species.

If there is a concern about antibiotic resistance or if ciprofloxacin is not effective, alternative antibiotics may be considered. Options could include other classes of antibiotics, such as cephalosporins or aminoglycosides, depending on the specific susceptibility profile of the bacteria and the patient's medical history.

It's important to perform susceptibility testing to determine the most effective antibiotic for treating the infection. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.","There are no comparative studies of antibiotic therapy for Citrobacter infections. Thus, treatment of Citrobacter infections follows the principles for treatment of other Enterobacteriaceae infections. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities described above,
					aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and the fourth-generation cephems, such as cefepime and cefpirome, would appear to be preferred therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections.. Citrobacter species are a common cause of nosocomial infections associated with patients that are undergoing prolonged hospital treatments. C. freundii has recently been reported to express resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotincs including piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam,
					vancomycin and cephalosporins. Isolation of ceftriaxone-resistant Citrobacter freundii (CRCF) has been associated with the overprescribed broad spectrum antibiotics.. The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins."

Given the history of plagiocephaly (flat head) and the concerns about his sitting position and sleeping habits, I recommend seeing a pediatric physical therapist or a pediatric orthopedic specialist. 

A pediatric physical therapist can evaluate his posture, muscle strength, and movement patterns, and provide exercises or strategies to improve his sitting position and overall back health. An orthopedic specialist can assess for any structural issues and provide guidance on any necessary interventions.

It's important to address these concerns early to prevent any further complications. If you feel that your pediatrician is not addressing your concerns adequately, it may be worthwhile to seek a second opinion.","The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and

This morning he woke up with a bit of blood drainage. Is that normal?","It's not uncommon for children with otitis media to experience some drainage from the ear, especially if there is inflammation or infection present. The presence of blood in the drainage can be concerning, however. It may indicate that there is irritation or damage to the ear canal or eardrum, possibly due to the infection or the use of ear drops. 

Since your son is already on amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, and using antipyrine-benzocaine ear drops for pain relief, it's important to monitor his symptoms closely. If the blood drainage continues, increases, or if he develops additional symptoms such as fever, increased pain, or changes in hearing, I recommend contacting your healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may want to examine his ear to ensure there are no complications from the otitis media.","With a severe ear infection, pressure may build up and cause the eardrum to rupture. Pus and blood may drain out. This usually relieves pain and pressure, and in most cases the eardrum heals on its own.. Middle ear infections may cause pain, hearing loss, and spontaneous rupture of the eardrum, resulting in a perforation. In this case,there may be infected or bloody drainage from the ear. Infections can cause a hole in the eardrum as a side effect of otitis media."

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have genetic components, particularly in certain types such as familial Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, which are hereditary. However, not all cases of dementia are inherited; many factors, including environmental and lifestyle influences, can contribute to its development. Therefore, while there is a genetic aspect to some forms of dementia, it is not solely passed down, and anyone can potentially develop dementia regardless of their family history.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease
					are not inherited."
"sleep apnea.  Is there a ""sleep apnea surgery"". I've heard that there is , but have never found a doctor that does this. My husband has been on C-pap for two years but has not been able to keep it on for more then 2 hours. He is not overweight, has had a stroke at 40 years old and double by-pass at
				50 years old. Otherwise he follows doctors orders and has no other problems. Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options available for treating sleep apnea, particularly for patients who do not respond well to CPAP therapy. The type of surgery often depends on the specific cause of the sleep apnea. Common surgical procedures include:

1. **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**: This surgery removes excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway.
2. **Genioglossus advancement**: This procedure repositions the tongue muscle attachment to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway during sleep.
3. **Maxillomandibular advancement**: This surgery moves the upper and lower jaw forward to enlarge the airway.
4. **Bariatric surgery**: In cases where obesity is a contributing factor, weight loss surgery may be considered.

Given your husband's medical history, including his stroke and heart surgery, it's essential to consult with a specialist who can evaluate his specific situation and determine the most appropriate treatment options. A sleep specialist or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor with experience in sleep apnea surgeries would be a good starting point. They can provide guidance on whether surgery is a viable option for him.","Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear,

Diahrrea . I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea. Then I stop it for about 2 days so I can have a bowel movement. But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge when managing chronic diarrhea with loperamide. While loperamide is effective in decreasing gastrointestinal motility and can help control diarrhea, it can also lead to softer stools or difficulty in having a bowel movement if used continuously. 

To find a happy medium, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adjust Dosage**: You might need to adjust the dosage of loperamide. Instead of stopping it completely, you could try a lower dose that still helps manage your symptoms without causing overly soft stools.

2. **Scheduled Dosing**: Instead of taking loperamide as needed, consider taking it on a regular schedule. This can help maintain a more consistent stool consistency.

3. **Dietary Modifications**: Pay attention to your diet. Incorporating more binding foods (like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) can help firm up stools. Avoiding high-fiber foods and dairy products may also be beneficial.

4. **Hydration**: Ensure you are staying well-hydrated, especially if you are experiencing diarrhea. Electrolyte solutions can help maintain your hydration levels.

5. **Consult Your Physician**: It's important to discuss your symptoms and any changes you make with your physician. They may suggest alternative treatments or additional medications that can help balance your bowel movements.

Finding the right balance may take some time, so keep track of your symptoms and any changes you make to your regimen.","IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule
					Chronic Diarrhea
					Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may
					then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
					The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further
					administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered."
"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Uveitis can be associated with autoimmune diseases, as it involves inflammation of the uvea, which can be triggered by the body's immune response mistakenly attacking its own tissues. While not all cases of uveitis are due to autoimmune diseases, many autoimmune conditions, such as Behçet's disease and Sjögren's syndrome, can lead to uveitis. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the underlying causes of uveitis in each patient to determine if it is related to an autoimmune process.","Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue
					by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.

Amlodipine. I am taking Amlodipine and it has caused my pause rate to be very high. Is there a weaning process when you stop taking Amlodipine and start atenolol? I am taking 5 mg of amlodipine and will be taking 50 mg of atenolol?,"Physician: It's important to approach the transition from amlodipine to atenolol carefully. While there isn't a specific ""weaning process"" for amlodipine like there might be for some other medications, it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely during this transition. 

You should not stop taking amlodipine abruptly without consulting your healthcare provider, as this could lead to a rebound effect, potentially increasing your blood pressure. Instead, your doctor may recommend a gradual reduction in the dose of amlodipine while starting atenolol. 

Make sure to discuss your concerns about the high pause rate with your physician, as they can provide personalized guidance based on your health status and needs. They may also want to monitor you more closely during this period to ensure a smooth transition.","Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks.

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"Dear Patient,

Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. It's understandable to feel worried after such an incident. Exposure to blood can be a potential risk for HIV transmission, especially if the blood comes from someone who is HIV positive. However, the risk of transmission through blood exposure depends on several factors, including the amount of blood, the presence of open wounds or mucous membranes, and the HIV status of the other person involved.

In your case, since you mentioned that you had blood splashed on your hand and face, it is important to consider the following:

1. **Type of Exposure**: If the blood came into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes (like your eyes), there may be a risk. If your skin was intact, the risk is significantly lower.

2. **Timing of Washing**: Washing the area after exposure is a good step, as it can help reduce the risk of infection.

3. **HIV Status of the Other Person**: If the other person was HIV positive and had a high viral load, the risk would be higher. If they were HIV negative or undetectable, the risk is much lower.

Given these factors, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your situation more thoroughly. They may recommend testing for HIV and other infections, as well as discussing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if appropriate.

Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek medical advice for further evaluation and support.

Best regards.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."
Swan NDC 0869-0871-43. I found 4 cases of expired (04/2010) Hydrogen Peroxide. How do I safely dispose of this product?,"To safely dispose of expired hydrogen peroxide, follow these steps:

1. **Check Local Regulations**: Before disposal, check your local regulations regarding the disposal of expired medications and chemicals. Some areas have specific guidelines for hazardous waste.

2. **Dilution**: If local regulations allow, you can dilute the hydrogen peroxide with water. This reduces its concentration and makes it safer for disposal.

3. **Pour Down the Drain**: After dilution, you can pour the solution down the sink or toilet, followed by running water to help flush it through the plumbing system. Ensure that you are not disposing of large quantities at once.

4. **Seal and Dispose**: If you prefer not to pour it down the drain, seal the hydrogen peroxide in its original container or another secure container. Dispose of it in your household trash, but ensure it is tightly sealed to prevent leaks.

5. **Take to a Disposal Facility**: If you have a large quantity or if local regulations require it, take the expired hydrogen peroxide to a hazardous waste disposal facility.

Always remember to wear gloves and take precautions to avoid contact with skin or eyes when handling expired chemicals.",Hydrogen peroxide solutions can be disposed of with no special treatment. You can safely pour them down the drain of a sink or into a toilet.
congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is primarily caused by embryologic defects in the diaphragm, which can lead to the protrusion of abdominal structures into the thorax. The exact etiology can vary, and it may be isolated or associated with syndromes or chromosomal abnormalities. Factors that may contribute to the development of CDH include genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and maternal health conditions during pregnancy.

Regarding cousin marriage, it can increase the risk of congenital disorders, including CDH, due to the potential for inherited genetic factors. However, the specific contribution of cousin marriage to the occurrence of CDH would depend on the genetic background of the families involved.

As for lung disease, babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia often experience associated pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs) and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to long-term respiratory issues. These may include chronic lung disease, reduced lung function, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The severity of these conditions can vary based on the extent of the hernia and the effectiveness of medical and surgical interventions.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","When it comes to handling food in the workplace, it's important to consider the implications of someone having shingles (herpes zoster). Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. While shingles itself is not directly contagious, the virus can be spread to individuals who have never had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against it, potentially leading to chickenpox in those individuals.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Transmission**: The varicella-zoster virus can be transmitted through direct contact with the fluid from the shingles blisters. Therefore, if someone with shingles has open sores, they should avoid direct contact with others, especially those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or unvaccinated.

2. **Food Handling**: If the person with shingles is handling food, it is crucial that they do not have any open sores or blisters that could come into contact with the food. Proper hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washing and wearing gloves, should be followed to minimize any risk of transmission.

3. **Workplace Policies**: Many workplaces have policies regarding illness and food handling. It may be advisable for the individual with shingles to refrain from food handling duties until their blisters have crusted over and they are no longer contagious.

4. **Consultation**: It may be beneficial for the workplace to consult with a healthcare professional or occupational health expert to determine the best course of action and ensure that all safety protocols are being followed.

In summary, while shingles is not directly contagious through food, precautions should be taken to prevent any potential transmission of the virus, especially in a food handling environment.","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
			. My question to you is: what is the reason that there is very little attentions is to Antiphosoholipid Syndrome? To find the causes and possibly some type of cure for us who struggle with this auto-immune blood disorder? I guess that since it is female directed (9-1 female to male) that
				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","The lack of attention to Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) may stem from several factors. Firstly, APS is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, which can overshadow its recognition as a distinct condition. Additionally, the demographic skew—where the majority of patients are women—might contribute to a perception that it is less critical, despite the serious complications it can cause, such as thrombosis and pregnancy-related issues.

Moreover, APS is a relatively rare condition, which can lead to fewer research initiatives and clinical trials focused specifically on it. This can result in a lack of awareness and understanding among healthcare providers and the general public. The complexity of autoimmune diseases, including APS, also makes it challenging to pinpoint specific causes and develop targeted treatments.

As a male patient with APS, your experience highlights the need for increased awareness and research into this syndrome, regardless of gender. Advocacy for more studies and clinical trials could help uncover potential treatments and improve the quality of life for those affected by APS.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is recommended to be taken in the evening because cholesterol synthesis in the liver is typically higher at night. By taking simvastatin in the evening, you can maximize its effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. 

Taking simvastatin in the morning may not cause harm, but it could potentially reduce its cholesterol-lowering effects since the body is more active in cholesterol production during the night. Therefore, for optimal results in managing cholesterol levels, it is best to adhere to the evening dosing recommendation.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."
"Prednisone	. My husband has been on Prednisone for almost a year for a Cancer treatment he had. He started at 30mg and stayed on 10mg until a couple weeks ago.

				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","Physician: It's important to understand that prednisone is a corticosteroid, and when someone has been on it for an extended period, like your husband, they may experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping the medication. The duration that prednisone stays in the system can vary, but generally, it can take several days to weeks for the drug to be fully eliminated from the body. 

The symptoms your husband is experiencing, such as chills, fever, and abdominal pain, can indeed be associated with steroid withdrawal syndrome. Other common withdrawal symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, joint pain, and mood changes. It's crucial to monitor these symptoms closely, as they can vary in intensity and duration.

I recommend that you consult with his healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms and determine if any further management is needed. They may suggest a gradual tapering of the medication rather than stopping abruptly, which can help minimize withdrawal effects. Additionally, they can assess whether any other underlying issues may be contributing to his current symptoms.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug. If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your
					body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual

				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great to hear that you're looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, especially given your active history! Managing asthma while exercising can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can find activities that are both safe and beneficial.

1. **Consult Your Doctor**: Before starting any new exercise program, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider. They can help assess your asthma severity and provide personalized recommendations.

2. **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always start with a gentle warm-up to prepare your lungs and muscles. Similarly, a cool-down period can help your body transition back to rest.

3. **Choose Low-Impact Activities**: Consider exercises that are less likely to trigger asthma symptoms. Some good options include:
   - **Walking**: Start with short distances and gradually increase as you feel more comfortable.
   - **Swimming**: The warm, moist air can be easier on your lungs, making swimming a great option.
   - **Cycling**: Riding a stationary bike indoors can help control environmental triggers.
   - **Yoga**: This can improve your breathing techniques and help with relaxation.

4. **Monitor Your Environment**: Pay attention to weather conditions. Cold air, high pollen counts, or pollution can exacerbate asthma symptoms. On days when the air quality is poor, consider indoor activities.

5. **Use Your Medication**: If prescribed, use your rescue inhaler before exercising, as directed by your physician. This can help prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.

6. **Listen to Your Body**: If you start to feel symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath, stop the activity and use your inhaler if needed. It's important to know your limits.

7. **Gradual Progression**: Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as your body adapts. 

8. **Join a Support Group**: Connecting with others who have asthma can provide motivation and tips on managing exercise with your condition.

Remember, the goal is to find activities that you enjoy and can do consistently while managing your asthma effectively. With the right precautions, you can safely engage in exercise and improve your overall health.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle-Branch Block, also known as bundle blockage, is a form of heart block where the electrical stimulation of the heart ventricles is interrupted at one of the branches of the Bundle of His. This interruption prevents the simultaneous depolarization of the two ventricles, which can lead to a condition known as ventricular dyssynchrony.

**Symptoms:**
The symptoms of Bundle-Branch Block can vary, but they may include:
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath, especially during exertion
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain or discomfort

In some cases, individuals may not experience any symptoms at all, and the condition may be discovered incidentally during an electrocardiogram (ECG).

**Management:**
The management of Bundle-Branch Block typically involves:
- Monitoring: Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider to monitor heart function.
- Treating underlying conditions: If the block is caused by another heart condition, such as coronary artery disease or hypertension, treating that condition may help.
- Medications: Depending on symptoms and underlying causes, medications may be prescribed to manage heart rate or blood pressure.
- Pacemaker: In cases where the block leads to significant symptoms or complications, a pacemaker may be recommended to help regulate the heart's electrical signals.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)"
general health. I have an infection in gums...dentist prescribed Cephalexin 500mg...Is this ok to take even though I am ALLERGIC TO PENICILLAN?,"Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which is structurally different from penicillin. While some individuals with a penicillin allergy may also react to cephalosporins, the risk is generally lower. However, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking cephalexin, especially given your allergy to penicillin. They can assess your specific situation and determine if cephalexin is safe for you to use.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Physician: Yes, arrhythmias can occur after an ablation procedure. While ablation is often performed to correct arrhythmias, there is a possibility of new arrhythmias developing as a result of the procedure. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but it generally ranges from 70% to 90% for many types of arrhythmias.

Regarding your Holter monitor results, a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21 is quite significant and concerning. A heart rate of 254 indicates a very high rate (tachycardia), while 21 is extremely low (bradycardia). These fluctuations could suggest underlying issues that need to be addressed. It is essential to discuss these findings in detail with your healthcare provider, who can interpret the results in the context of your overall health and symptoms. Further evaluation may be necessary to determine the best course of action.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil, the same active ingredient found in Viagra. Both medications are used to treat erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow to the penis, helping to achieve and maintain an erection. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **FDA Approval**: As you mentioned, Fildena is not FDA approved, which means it has not undergone the same rigorous testing and evaluation for safety and efficacy as Viagra. This could raise concerns about the quality and reliability of the product.

2. **Dosage and Formulation**: Fildena may come in different dosages, similar to Viagra, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage for your needs.

3. **Side Effects**: Both Fildena and Viagra can have similar side effects, including headaches, flushing, nasal congestion, and potential interactions with other medications. It's crucial to discuss any existing health conditions and medications with your physician before trying Fildena.

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While naltrexone is primarily known as an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorder, some studies suggest it may have potential benefits in treating various mood disorders, including severe depression. 

However, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more clinical trials are needed to determine its efficacy and safety for this specific use. It would be advisable to consult recent clinical studies or trials listed on platforms like ClinicalTrials.gov to find specific studies investigating low-dose naltrexone for severe depression. If you are considering this treatment, discussing it with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the potential risks and benefits based on the latest research is essential.","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be transmitted through various means, depending on the type of hepatitis virus involved. The most common modes of transmission include:

1. **Hepatitis A**: This virus is typically spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, often due to poor sanitation or hygiene practices.

2. **Hepatitis B**: This virus is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, or vaginal secretions. Common routes include unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth.

3. **Hepatitis C**: Similar to Hepatitis B, it is primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact, often through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, though this is less common.

4. **Hepatitis D**: This virus only occurs in those infected with Hepatitis B, as it requires the Hepatitis B virus to replicate. It is transmitted in similar ways to Hepatitis B.

5. **Hepatitis E**: This virus is mainly spread through the consumption of contaminated water, similar to Hepatitis A.

To reduce the risk of catching hepatitis, it is important to practice good hygiene, ensure safe food and water consumption, and engage in safe practices regarding blood and sexual health. Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and B, which can help prevent infection.","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or tinea cruris, is primarily a fungal infection that affects the groin area, and it typically presents with symptoms such as itching, redness, and a rash. Small lumps under the skin around the scrotum are not a common symptom of jock itch. However, they could be indicative of other conditions, such as cysts, infections, or other dermatological issues. It's important to have any new or unusual lumps evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and whether any treatment is necessary. If you're experiencing discomfort or if the lumps persist, I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

general health. What are the causes of rib cage pain? And and the remedy,"Rib cage pain can be caused by a variety of conditions, including:

1. **Tietze's Syndrome**: This is characterized by painful swellings of the costal cartilages, particularly the second rib, and can mimic the pain associated with coronary artery disease.

2. **Pleurisy**: This involves inflammation of the pleura, the lining of the lungs, and can lead to sharp chest pain, especially when breathing deeply or coughing.

3. **Slipping Rib Syndrome**: This condition occurs when the lower ribs become hypermobile and can cause pain due to irritation of the surrounding tissues.

4. **Costochondritis**: This is inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the sternum, leading to localized pain in the rib cage.

5. **Muscle Strain**: Overexertion or injury to the muscles around the rib cage can also result in pain.

6. **Infections or Inflammation**: Conditions such as pneumonia or other infections can cause referred pain to the rib cage area.

For remedies, treatment options may include:

- **Rest**: Allowing the body to heal can be beneficial, especially for muscle strains.
- **Ice or Heat Therapy**: Applying ice packs can reduce inflammation, while heat can help relax tense muscles.
- **Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.
- **Physical Therapy**: For conditions like Tietze's Syndrome or costochondritis, physical therapy may help improve mobility and reduce pain.
- **Corticosteroid Injections**: In some cases, injections may be used to reduce inflammation in the affected area.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to the specific cause of rib cage pain.","Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
					Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
					Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis)
					Osteoporosis
					Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
					Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.

					Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain."

general health. Is there always elevated temperature associated with appendicitis?,"While fever is a common symptom associated with appendicitis, it is not always present. Appendicitis typically leads to an abnormal elevation of body temperature due to the inflammatory process. However, some patients may not exhibit a significant fever, especially in the early stages of the condition. It's important to consider other symptoms and perform a thorough evaluation to confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main
					symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include
					Swelling in the abdomen

While the extended-release (ER) version is typically taken once a day, the immediate-release form, such as the 5 mg tablets your urologist prescribed, is often taken multiple times a day. 

If your urologist has prescribed Oxybutynin 5 mg tablets to be taken twice a day, it is likely based on your individual condition and response to the medication. It is important to follow your urologist's instructions. If you have any concerns or questions about the dosage, I recommend discussing them directly with your urologist for clarification.","Adults

					2. Coadministration of NEURONTIN (125 to 500 mg; N=48) decreases hydrocodone (10 mg; N=50) C max and AUC values in a dose-dependent manner relative to administration of hydrocodone alone; C max and AUC values are 3% to 4% lower, respectively, after administration of 125 mg NEURONTIN and 21% to
					22% lower, respectively, after administration of 500 mg NEURONTIN. The mechanism for this interaction is unknown. Hydrocodone increases gabapentin AUC values by 14%. The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known."
Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to evaluate each medication's effects and potential interactions.

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: Taking diclofenac (an NSAID) with lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) can potentially reduce the effectiveness of lisinopril in controlling blood pressure. Additionally, NSAIDs can increase the risk of kidney problems, especially in patients who are already taking medications that affect kidney function, such as lisinopril. Therefore, caution is advised, and it may be necessary to monitor kidney function and blood pressure closely.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and naproxen are NSAIDs. Taking them together can increase the risk of side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and kidney damage. It is generally not recommended to use two NSAIDs simultaneously unless specifically directed by a healthcare provider.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is not an NSAID and does not have the same anti-inflammatory properties. It is generally considered safe to take acetaminophen with diclofenac, but it is important to adhere to the recommended dosages for both medications to avoid potential liver damage from excessive acetaminophen use.

In summary, while it may be safe to take diclofenac with extra-strength Tylenol, caution should be exercised when combining diclofenac with lisinopril or Aleve. Always consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

					Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL
					BLEEDING, ULCERATION, PERFORATION and DRUG INTERACTIONS). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in ""over the counter"" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.. Some foods and medicines may affect how lisinopril works. Tell your doctor if you are using any of the following:

					Aliskiren, everolimus, lithium, sirolimus, temsirolimus
					Another blood pressure medicine, including an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
					Diuretic (water pill, including amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene)
					Insulin or diabetes medicine
					NSAID pain or arthritis medicine (including aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen)"
"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a serious genetic condition that typically leads to a range of severe physical and intellectual disabilities. Unfortunately, the prognosis for individuals with this syndrome is generally poor, and many affected infants do not survive beyond their first year of life. For those who do survive, the severity of symptoms can vary, but many will experience progressive complications over time, including worsening developmental delays and health issues.

As for diagnosing Patau syndrome, it is typically done through genetic testing, which can confirm the presence of an extra chromosome 13. This can be performed during pregnancy through procedures like chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, or after birth through blood tests. Physical examinations may also reveal characteristic features of the syndrome, such as microcephaly, polydactyly, and other abnormalities.

If you have further questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!","Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed
					eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within

"quinine in seltzer water.. quinine in seltzer water.
				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct ""dosage""? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.","Quinine can be effective for easing leg cramps, as it has been used for this purpose due to its effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. However, it's important to note that quinine should be used with caution and under medical supervision, as it can have side effects and may interact with other medications.

As for the dosage, it is crucial to follow the guidance of a healthcare professional. The typical dosage of quinine for leg cramps can vary, and it is often recommended to use it in a controlled form, such as a prescribed medication, rather than in a beverage like seltzer water. Drinking quinine in seltzer water may not provide a consistent or safe dosage.

Please consult with your physician to determine the appropriate dosage and to ensure that it is safe for you to use quinine in this manner, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.","Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For the treatment and prevention of mite infestation in humans, particularly with a focus on non-toxic options or those with minimal side effects, consider the following recommendations:

### Treatment Protocol:
1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: A topical insecticide that is effective against mites. It is generally well-tolerated but may cause mild skin irritation in some individuals.
   - **Ivermectin**: Available in both topical and oral forms, it is effective against scabies mites. The topical formulation is often preferred for its lower side effect profile.

2. **Antihistamines**: To alleviate itching and discomfort, over-the-counter antihistamines can be used. These are generally safe and can help manage allergic reactions to mite bites.

3. **Moisturizers**: Regular application of emollients can help soothe the skin and reduce irritation caused by scratching.

### Prevention Protocol:
1. **Environmental Control**:
   - **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water to eliminate mites. Vacuum carpets and upholstered furniture frequently.
   - **Humidity Control**: Keep indoor humidity low (below 50%) to deter mite proliferation, as they thrive in humid environments.

2. **Personal Hygiene**: 
   - Regular bathing and maintaining clean skin can help reduce the risk of mite infestations. 

3. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Essential Oils**: Some essential oils, such as tea tree oil and lavender oil, have been noted for their potential insecticidal properties. Diluting these oils in a carrier oil and applying them to the skin may provide some protective benefits.

4. **Avoidance of Known Triggers**: If you have a known sensitivity to certain environments (like dusty areas or specific animals), try to limit exposure to these triggers.

### Note:
Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any treatment, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant. They can provide personalized advice and ensure that the chosen treatment is safe and appropriate for your specific situation.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."
meds taken with wine at dinnertime. Is it safe to take my meds with wine at dinnertime?,"Physician: It's important to be cautious when taking medications with alcohol, such as wine. Alcohol can interact with many medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects. I recommend reviewing your specific medications to determine if there are any known interactions with alcohol. It's best to consult with your pharmacist or healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding your situation.","Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can

neo oxy. pkease send me the indication and usage info for this powder. NEO-OXY 100/100 MR - neomycin sulfate and oxytetracycline hydrochloride powder,"The NEO-OXY 100/100 MR powder contains two active ingredients: neomycin sulfate and oxytetracycline hydrochloride. 

**Indications and Usage:**

1. **Neomycin Sulfate**: 
   - It is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacterial infections. Neomycin works by irreversibly binding to the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis, which ultimately leads to bacterial cell death. It is commonly used for treating skin infections, eye infections, and as part of bowel preparation before surgery.

2. **Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride**: 
   - This is a tetracycline antibiotic that interferes with protein synthesis by preventing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. It is often used to treat various skin conditions and infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

**Combined Use**: 
The combination of neomycin sulfate and oxytetracycline hydrochloride in NEO-OXY 100/100 MR is typically indicated for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the skin or soft tissues, where both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria may be involved.

**Contraindications**: 
- Neomycin sulfate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to neomycin or other aminoglycosides.

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Maternal Diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, the newborn may produce excess insulin, leading to low blood sugar levels after birth.
2. **Prematurity**: Premature infants may have immature metabolic systems, making them more susceptible to hypoglycemia.
3. **Inadequate Feeding**: Newborns who do not feed adequately, especially in the first few hours after birth, are at risk of hypoglycemia.
4. **Infection or Illness**: Any underlying infection or illness can affect the newborn's ability to maintain normal blood glucose levels.
5. **Low Birth Weight**: Infants with low birth weight may have less glycogen stores, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Manage Diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, it is crucial to manage blood sugar levels effectively throughout the pregnancy.
2. **Regular Prenatal Care**: Attend all prenatal appointments to monitor the health of both the mother and the fetus.
3. **Balanced Nutrition**: Maintain a well-balanced diet during pregnancy, ensuring adequate intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to support fetal growth.
4. **Educate on Feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed promptly and adequately, especially within the first few hours.
5. **Monitor for Symptoms**: Be aware of any signs of hypoglycemia in the newborn, such as lethargy, poor feeding, or unusual irritability, and seek medical attention if these occur.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, a CT scan can detect diverticulosis and diverticulitis even if there is no active infection at the time. Diverticulosis, which is characterized by the presence of multiple diverticula in the walls of the colon, can be identified on a CT scan due to the structural changes in the bowel. Similarly, diverticulitis may show signs such as thickening of the bowel wall or the presence of diverticula, even in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. Therefore, a CT scan is a useful imaging tool for diagnosing both conditions.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by cold viruses while others are not can be attributed to several factors, primarily related to the immune response. When a cold virus is transmitted through contagion, individuals with a robust immune response may be able to fend off the infection more effectively than those with a weaker immune system. 

1. **Immune Response**: The immune system plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to infections. Individuals with a strong immune response can recognize and eliminate pathogens more efficiently. Factors such as genetics, overall health, nutrition, and previous exposure to similar viruses can influence the strength of one's immune response.

2. **Viral Load**: The amount of virus (viral load) that a person is exposed to can also impact whether they become ill. A higher viral load may overwhelm the immune system, leading to infection, while a lower viral load might not trigger an illness in a person with a strong immune defense.

3. **Environmental Factors**: Other factors, such as stress levels, sleep quality, and pre-existing health conditions, can affect how well the immune system functions. For example, chronic stress can weaken the immune response, making a person more susceptible to infections.

In summary, while contagion is the mechanism through which cold viruses spread, the immune response and individual health factors determine who gets sick and who remains unaffected.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg- 1 daily. Doctor prescribed for type 2 diabetes w/Metformin 500 mg 2 times daily. Pharmacy refused to fill stating overdose of Metformin. Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"The physician is correct in prescribing Janumet XR 50 mg/1000 mg once daily for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Janumet XR contains metformin hydrochloride as one of its active ingredients, and the prescribed dosage is within the recommended limits for metformin.

The maximum daily dosage of metformin for adults is typically 2000 mg to 3000 mg, depending on the specific formulation and the patient's tolerance. In this case, Janumet XR provides 1000 mg of metformin per dose, and taking it once daily would not exceed the maximum daily dosage. 

The pharmacy's refusal to fill the prescription may be based on a misunderstanding of the dosage or the combination of medications. It would be advisable for the physician to clarify the prescription with the pharmacy, ensuring they understand that the patient is taking Janumet XR as prescribed and that the total daily dosage of metformin is appropriate.",The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets are 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).
SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) typically occurs in children and young adults, usually 2-8 years after a measles infection. While it is rare, the condition is primarily associated with individuals who have had measles, particularly those who did not receive the measles vaccination. 

In your son's case, since he is 33 years old and did not have the measles vaccination, he may not be at immediate risk for SSPE unless he had a prior measles infection. However, SSPE is generally not reported in adults who have not had measles, as the condition is most commonly diagnosed in younger populations. 

It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and to discuss any potential risks based on his medical history.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","Physician: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a complex condition that can involve various symptoms, including vascular malformations, overgrowth of tissues, and other associated anomalies. Since your granddaughter is only 5 months old and her leg is most affected, it's important to consult with a specialist who has experience in managing this syndrome.

Currently, treatment options may include:

1. **Monitoring and Supportive Care**: Regular follow-ups with a pediatrician and specialists in vascular anomalies can help monitor her condition as she grows.

2. **Physical Therapy**: This can help improve mobility and manage any discomfort associated with overgrowth or vascular issues.

3. **Surgical Interventions**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to address significant vascular malformations or to improve function and appearance. This would typically be considered based on her specific symptoms and overall health.

4. **Research and Clinical Trials**: There may be ongoing clinical trials focused on Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. I recommend checking ClinicalTrials.gov for any studies that might be relevant to her condition. Participating in a clinical trial could provide access to new treatments and therapies.

5. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Engaging a team that includes pediatricians, vascular surgeons, dermatologists, and physical therapists can provide comprehensive care tailored to her needs.

It's crucial to have a detailed discussion with her healthcare team to determine the best course of action based on her specific symptoms and overall health. If you have any further questions or need assistance finding specialists or resources, please let me know.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.

					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."
Iron Overdose. Um...i took 25 iron pills...what do i do...this was last night,"Physician: It’s important that you seek medical attention immediately. Taking 25 iron pills can lead to serious health complications, including iron toxicity. Please go to the nearest emergency room or call emergency services right away. Do not wait, as prompt treatment is crucial in cases of iron overdose.","Iron is a mineral found in many over-the-counter supplements. Iron overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this mineral. This can be by accident or on purpose.

Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"In the case of inherited ricketts, if the mother has an autosomal dominant form of the condition, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant allele from her. Since you mentioned that the mother has passed the condition to one child (A) but not to the other (B), it indicates that child B did not inherit the mutant allele.

As a result, child B would not be a carrier of the condition and therefore would not pass it on to their own children. The likelihood of child B passing the condition to their child is 0%.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR A1298C variant is a common genetic polymorphism that can influence folate metabolism and homocysteine levels in the body. Being homozygous for this variant (having two copies of the A1298C allele) may be associated with certain health issues, particularly related to elevated homocysteine levels, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and complications during pregnancy.

Long-term prognosis for individuals with homozygous MTHFR A1298C may vary based on several factors, including lifestyle, diet, and the presence of other health conditions. It is essential to monitor homocysteine levels and ensure adequate intake of folate and other B vitamins, as these can help mitigate some of the risks associated with this genetic variant.

In summary, while being homozygous for MTHFR A1298C may pose certain health risks, proactive management through dietary and lifestyle modifications can significantly improve long-term health outcomes. Regular consultations with healthcare providers for monitoring and personalized care are recommended.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can potentially lead to various side effects, including gastrointestinal issues like flatulence. While Vitamin D is essential for regulating calcium and maintaining bone health, excessive intake can lead to toxicity, which may manifest as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and other symptoms, including gastrointestinal discomfort.

Regarding safety, high doses of Vitamin D may be necessary in certain cases to correct very low levels, but this should always be done under medical supervision. It's important to monitor blood levels of Vitamin D and adjust the dosage accordingly to avoid toxicity. If you are considering such a high dose, please consult with your healthcare provider to ensure it is appropriate for your specific situation and to discuss any potential side effects, including flatulence.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To prevent a shingles outbreak, vaccination is highly recommended. The shingles vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of developing shingles and its associated complications. It's particularly advised for individuals over the age of 50 or those with weakened immune systems. Additionally, maintaining a healthy immune system through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing stress can also help reduce the likelihood of an outbreak. If you have had chickenpox in the past, it's important to discuss vaccination options with your healthcare provider to ensure you are adequately protected against shingles.","How Can You Reduce Your Risk of Getting Shingles?
					Vaccination is the only way to reduce your risk of shingles and PHN. CDC recommends adults age 60 years or older receive a single dose of shingles vaccine.

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and cysts, especially with your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While I cannot provide specific statistics without more context, I can share some general information.

Thyroid tumors can vary widely in their behavior. Most thyroid nodules are benign, but the risk of malignancy increases with the size of the tumor. Tumors greater than 1 cm are typically monitored closely, as they may require further evaluation, such as a biopsy, to determine if they are cancerous.

In terms of thyroid cancer statistics, the overall incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing, but it is still relatively rare compared to other cancers. The prognosis for thyroid cancer is generally good, especially for well-differentiated types like papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, which have high survival rates.

Given your CVID, it's important to maintain regular follow-ups with your endocrinologist, as your immune status can influence your overall health and response to any potential treatments. If you have specific concerns about your tumor or cysts, I recommend discussing them directly with your healthcare provider, who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current condition.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the
					development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival over the 4

If you have any specific questions or concerns about diabetes, feel free to ask!","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."

				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Trisomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality where there is an extra copy of chromosome 7 in somatic cells. This condition can be associated with various diseases and may occur in congenital situations. 

Regarding your question about the potential causes of trisomy 7, it is important to note that chromosomal abnormalities like this can arise from errors during cell division, specifically during the formation of eggs or sperm. This means that the extra chromosome could originate from either the maternal or paternal side. 

As for whether you could be a carrier, it is generally not the case that individuals are ""carriers"" of trisomy conditions like trisomy 7 in the same way that one might be a carrier of a recessive genetic disorder. Trisomy conditions typically occur as a result of random errors in cell division rather than being inherited. However, genetic counseling and further genetic studies can provide more personalized insights into your situation.

The causes of trisomy can include advanced maternal age, but it can also occur in younger women without any identifiable risk factors. It is essential to discuss your specific case with a genetic counselor or a specialist who can provide more detailed information based on your medical history and the results of your genetic studies. They can help you understand the implications of the findings and any potential next steps for future pregnancies.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."
metformin. Does metformin cause high blood pressure?,"Metformin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is not typically associated with causing high blood pressure. In fact, some studies suggest that metformin may have a neutral or even beneficial effect on blood pressure in diabetic patients. However, individual responses can vary, and other factors such as lifestyle, diet, and additional medications may influence blood pressure levels. If you have concerns about blood pressure while taking metformin, it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","1. This meta-analysis suggested that metformin could effectively lower SBP in nondiabetic patients, especially in those with impaired glucose tolerance or obesity.. 2. Metformin does not significantly affect BP in patients with Type 2 diabetes intensively treated with insulin."
aclidinium	. is this a steroid? is there a problem using this if there is a possibility of the need for cataract surgery within the next 12 months?,"Aclidinium is not a steroid; it is a medication primarily used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. It belongs to a class of drugs known as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). 

Regarding the potential need for cataract surgery within the next 12 months, there is no direct contraindication for using aclidinium in relation to cataract surgery. However, it is always important to discuss any concerns about medications and upcoming surgeries with your healthcare provider, as they can provide personalized advice based on your overall health and specific circumstances.","1. Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.

					2. There are currently six muscarinic receptor antagonists licenced for use in the treatment of COPD, the short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMAs) ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) aclidinium bromide, tiotropium
					bromide, glycopyrronium bromide and umeclidinium bromide. Concerns have been raised about possible associations of muscarinic receptor antagonists with cardiovascular safety, but the most advanced compounds seem to have an improved safety profile.

					3. The use of TUDORZA PRESSAIR is contraindicated in the following conditions:
					*Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] *Hypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"
intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine can have several detrimental effects on digestion and absorption in the intestines. Here are some general effects:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine constricts blood vessels, which can reduce blood flow to the intestines. This decreased circulation can impair the digestive process and the absorption of nutrients.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to issues such as delayed gastric emptying or increased transit time in the intestines. This can result in symptoms like bloating, constipation, or diarrhea.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may alter the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and other glands, which can hinder the breakdown of food and the absorption of nutrients.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcers, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These conditions can further complicate digestion and absorption.

5. **Impaired Nutrient Absorption**: Smoking can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, due to impaired absorption in the intestines. For example, smokers may have lower levels of vitamin C and other antioxidants.

6. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can disrupt the balance of gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in digestion and absorption. An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to digestive issues and affect overall health.

7. **Increased Risk of Cancer**: Long-term smoking is a significant risk factor for various cancers, including colorectal cancer. The presence of cancer can severely impact digestion and absorption due to obstruction or changes in intestinal function.

In summary, smoking and nicotine can negatively affect the digestive process and nutrient absorption through various mechanisms, leading to potential gastrointestinal issues and nutrient deficiencies. Quitting smoking can help improve digestive health and overall well-being.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa."
sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Yes, swelling in the feet, ankles, and legs can occur in individuals with fibromyalgia. While fibromyalgia primarily causes muscle pain and tenderness, it can also be associated with other symptoms, including swelling. This swelling may be due to various factors, such as inflammation, fluid retention, or even the effects of inactivity. It's important to monitor your symptoms and discuss any new or worsening swelling with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.","1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","It's understandable to be concerned after an accidental needle stick, especially in the context of a cancer patient. However, cancer itself is not transmitted through blood contact or needle sticks. Cancer is not an infectious disease; it does not spread from person to person like a virus or bacteria.

That said, if the needle was used on your uncle and there was blood on it, there is a potential risk for blood-borne infections, depending on his health status and any underlying conditions. It's important to monitor for any signs of infection and consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. They may recommend testing or preventive measures based on the specifics of the situation.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities, especially if those activities put excessive strain on the plantar fascia. Engaging in high-impact exercises or standing for prolonged periods can exacerbate the inflammation and pain associated with this condition.

In addition to weight-bearing activities, other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper arch support or cushioning can increase stress on the plantar fascia.
2. **Overuse**: Increasing the intensity or duration of physical activities too quickly can lead to aggravation.
3. **Biomechanical Issues**: Conditions such as flat feet or high arches can contribute to an imbalance that aggravates plantar fasciitis.
4. **Obesity**: Excess body weight can place additional stress on the plantar fascia.
5. **Tight Muscles**: Tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon can limit ankle mobility and increase strain on the plantar fascia.

It's important to manage these aggravating factors to help alleviate symptoms and promote healing. If you have further questions or need specific recommendations, feel free to ask!","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can be detected in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract through various diagnostic procedures. The upper GI tract includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, and imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans or endoscopy can help identify abnormalities in these areas. 

Liver cancer, being a primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm, may also present with symptoms or findings that can be observed during upper GI evaluations, especially if there is associated lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) in the region. Additionally, procedures like radionuclide studies or endoscopic evaluations can provide insights into the presence of malignancies in the liver or lymph nodes. 

If there are specific concerns about lymph nodes or liver cancer, further targeted imaging or biopsies may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					anemia
					gastroesophageal reflux disease
					ulcers
					cancer
					inflammation, or swelling
					precancerous abnormalities

					2. Tests for Liver Cancer

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"Yes, an abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious complications, including bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. If bacteria from the abscess enter the bloodstream, they can travel to the heart and cause infections such as endocarditis, which can increase the risk of a heart attack. Additionally, the systemic effects of an untreated infection can strain the heart and lead to other cardiovascular issues. It's important to address dental infections promptly to prevent such complications.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Ischemic syncope refers to a temporary loss of consciousness due to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, often associated with cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). In the context of a stroke diagnosis, it indicates that the patient has experienced a cerebrovascular accident characterized by brain ischemia, which leads to sudden neurological dysfunction. This condition can be classified based on the type of tissue necrosis, the anatomical location, and the nature of the ischemia (hemorrhagic vs. non-hemorrhagic). Diagnosis typically involves a thorough assessment, including physical examination and possibly imaging studies, to determine the specific nature and cause of the stroke.","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Autoimmune illness. What doctor specializes in testing for and treatment of autoimmune illness?,"The physician who specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune illnesses is a Rheumatologist. Rheumatologists are experts in managing rheumatic diseases, which often include various autoimmune disorders. They perform tests to assess autoimmune conditions and provide appropriate treatment options.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any

"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is known to potentially cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect. This is primarily due to its mechanism of action as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which can affect sexual function by altering neurotransmitter levels in the brain that are involved in sexual arousal and performance.

The exact minimum amount of Effexor that may cause ED can vary significantly from person to person, as individual responses to medication can differ based on factors such as dosage, duration of use, and personal health conditions. Some patients may experience sexual side effects at lower doses, while others may not experience these effects even at higher doses.

If you are concerned about the potential for ED while taking Effexor, it is important to discuss this with your physician. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and may consider adjusting your dosage or exploring alternative treatments if necessary.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) have been discussed in relation to erectile dysfunction (ED) due to their potential effects on blood flow and hormonal balance. While there isn't a definitive timeline for when NSAIDs were first implicated in ED, studies and clinical observations have suggested that long-term use of these medications may contribute to erectile issues. The exact duration and extent of this association can vary based on individual patient factors, the specific NSAID used, and the dosage. It's important to consider that while NSAIDs are available as non-prescription drugs, their impact on erectile function may not be widely recognized or reported in all cases. If you have concerns about NSAID use and erectile dysfunction, it would be advisable to discuss this with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and potential alternatives.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by a pathological constriction at the aortic valve, which restricts the outflow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. This can lead to various symptoms and complications, including fatigue and drowsiness, as the heart struggles to pump blood effectively. 

The condition can manifest in different ways, including supravalvular and subvalvular stenosis, and is often associated with congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. It can also be linked to other health issues, such as hypertension and heart murmurs, which are sounds produced by turbulent blood flow through the heart.

Diagnosis typically involves echocardiography and auscultation to detect heart murmurs, which can indicate the presence of aortic stenosis. Treatment options may include monitoring, medication, or surgical interventions such as aortic valve replacement, depending on the severity of the condition.

If you have specific questions or concerns about aortic stenosis, feel free to ask!","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"Leukocytosis, or an increase in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the body, can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:

1. **Infection**: The body often responds to infections (bacterial, viral, or parasitic) by increasing white blood cell production to help fight off the invading microorganisms.

2. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases or tissue injury, can also lead to leukocytosis as part of the body's healing response.

3. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger an increase in white blood cell count.

4. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, can cause an increase in leukocyte levels.

5. **Other Medical Conditions**: Conditions like leukemia or other bone marrow disorders can lead to elevated white blood cell counts.

6. **Fever**: A febrile response can also be associated with leukocytosis, as the body mobilizes its immune response.

If you have specific symptoms or concerns, it would be best to discuss them with your healthcare provider for a more tailored evaluation.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
					Chronic myelogenous leukemia
					Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine
					Infections, bacterial or viral
