Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases are both hereditary conditions, but they are distinct disorders with different genetic causes and manifestations. 

1. **Noonan Syndrome**: This is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by features such as short stature, webbed neck, ptosis, skeletal malformations, and various cardiac abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in several genes, with PTPN11 being the most common. Noonan syndrome can occur in both males and females and is associated with a normal karyotype (46,XX and 46,XY).

2. **Polycystic Kidney Diseases (PKD)**: These are hereditary diseases characterized by the progressive expansion of numerous cysts within the kidneys. PKD can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. The condition leads to kidney dysfunction and can be associated with other systemic issues.

While there is no direct relation mentioned between Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases in the provided content, both conditions fall under the broader category of congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. Additionally, both can involve renal abnormalities, but they do so through different genetic mechanisms and clinical presentations.

If you are looking for specific references or studies that link Noonan syndrome with polycystic kidney diseases, it may be beneficial to consult medical literature or genetic databases for any emerging research that explores potential overlaps or co-occurrences in patients.","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"As a physician, I would advise the following for a patient with a positive VDRL test:

### Diagnosis:
1. **Confirmatory Testing**: A positive VDRL test indicates the presence of antibodies that may suggest syphilis, but it is not specific. It is important to follow up with more specific tests, such as the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) or the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.

2. **Clinical Evaluation**: A thorough clinical evaluation should be conducted to assess for any signs or symptoms of syphilis, such as sores, rashes, or other related symptoms.

3. **Assessment of Stage**: If syphilis is confirmed, it is important to determine the stage of the disease (primary, secondary, latent, or tertiary) to guide treatment.

### Precautions:
1. **Inform Sexual Partners**: It is crucial to inform any recent sexual partners about the positive test result so they can also get tested and treated if necessary.

2. **Avoid Sexual Activity**: Until a definitive diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated, it is advisable to abstain from sexual activity to prevent transmission.

3. **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor treatment response and ensure that the infection is resolved.

4. **Education**: Educate yourself about syphilis, its transmission, and prevention methods to reduce the risk of future infections.

5. **Consider Testing for Other STIs**: Since syphilis can co-occur with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), it may be beneficial to get tested for other STIs as well.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the next steps, please feel free to ask.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."
"how much glucagon.  How much glucose is in my GlucaGen HypoKit ? Just curious, I know that there is enough because I have used it. Thank you very much","The GlucaGen HypoKit contains glucagon as its active ingredient, specifically 1 mg of glucagon in the form of injectable powder for injection. However, it does not contain glucose itself. Glucagon works by increasing blood glucose levels, which is particularly useful in treating hypoglycemia.

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The administration of anesthesia during a hip replacement operation for a patient with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) should be approached with caution, as FXTAS is associated with neurological symptoms such as intention tremor, ataxia, and cognitive decline. While anesthesia is generally safe for most patients, individuals with neurological conditions may have unique responses to anesthetic agents.

It is important to consider the following:

1. **Neurological Effects**: FXTAS can lead to changes in brain function, and anesthesia may interact with these changes. The neurologic effects of anesthesia can vary, and some patients may experience increased confusion or cognitive impairment postoperatively.

2. **Monitoring**: Close monitoring in the recovery room is essential, especially for patients with FXTAS, to manage any potential complications or adverse effects related to anesthesia.

3. **Anesthesia Type**: The choice of anesthetic agents and techniques may need to be tailored to minimize risks. Discussing the specific anesthetic plan with the anesthesiologist and the surgical team is crucial.

4. **Preoperative Assessment**: A thorough preoperative assessment should be conducted to evaluate the patient's neurological status and any other comorbidities that may affect anesthesia management.

In summary, while anesthesia is necessary for the hip replacement procedure, it is vital to have a comprehensive discussion with the surgical and anesthesia teams to ensure the safest approach for a patient with FXTAS.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, Ocella, like other hormonal birth control methods, can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms your daughter is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, swelling in her thigh, and large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could be indicative of DVT or other complications. Given that these symptoms have worsened after childbirth, it is crucial for her to discuss this with her doctor as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is important to assess her condition and determine the appropriate course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","Given your history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and your allergies to penicillin and dairy products, it’s important to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective for UTIs and do not contain these allergens.

1. **Nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals)**: This is often used for treating UTIs and may be a suitable option for you. It is generally well-tolerated and does not contain dairy.

2. **Cefaclor anhydrous**: This is a cephalosporin antibiotic that may be effective for UTIs. However, since you have a penicillin allergy, you should discuss this option with your doctor to ensure it is safe for you.

3. **Ampicillin (anhydrous)**: This is another option, but again, it is a penicillin derivative, so it may not be suitable for you.

4. **Cefotetan disodium**: This is another cephalosporin that might be considered, but similar caution applies due to your penicillin allergy.

5. **Cycloserine**: This is less commonly used for UTIs but may be an option if other treatments fail.

It’s crucial to have a thorough discussion with your healthcare provider about your allergies and the best course of treatment. They may also consider testing for antibiotic resistance to ensure the chosen medication will be effective against the bacteria causing your UTI.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Yes, a streptococcal infection can potentially lead to complications that may result in invasive diseases, although it is not a direct cause of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). Streptococcal infections can trigger immune responses that may exacerbate underlying autoimmune conditions or lead to secondary infections that could complicate a patient's health. Symptoms of streptococcal infections, such as fever, sore throat, and skin manifestations, may overlap with some symptoms seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, such as respiratory issues. However, granulomatosis with polyangiitis is primarily an autoimmune condition characterized by vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation, which is distinct from infections caused by streptococcus. It is important to evaluate the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.
					* GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.The cause of GPA is unknown. GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.. Wegener's granulomatosis triggered by infection?
					Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease of unknown origin, although recent studies suggest that auto-immune mechanisms and infection play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. During follow-up, nasal carriage of Staphyloccocus Aureus could be documented. An overview of Wegener's
					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or ""group A strep."" This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is
					external).

					Severe Strep Infections

					Some types of group A strep bacteria cause severe infections, such as

					Bacteremia (bloodstream infections) - To learn more visit visit the MedlinePlus sepsis site (link is external).
					Toxic shock syndrome (multi-organ infection) - To learn more visit the MedlinePlus toxic shock syndrome site (link is external).
					Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) - To learn more visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention necrotizing fasciitis site (link is external).
					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

					Fever and chills
					Cough
					Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
					Chest pain
					Skin and soft-tissue infections often appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be:

					Red
					Swollen or painful
					Warm to the touch
					Full of pus or other drainage
					These skin infections may also be accompanied by a fever.

					Bone and joint infections often appear as pain in the infected area and might also include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Swelling
					Stiffness or inability to use affected limb or joint
					Rarely in adults, group B strep bacteria can cause meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord)."
"Diabetes and pain control. 
				How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.","To narrow your search for information regarding pain (joint) medication suitable for a person with Type 2 diabetes, consider the following steps:

1. **Focus on Analgesics**: Look for analgesics that are known to be safe for individuals with diabetes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are commonly used pain relievers that may be appropriate.

2. **Review Drug Interactions**: Investigate potential drug interactions between analgesics and diabetes medications. This will help ensure that the pain medication does not adversely affect blood sugar levels or interact negatively with diabetes treatments.

3. **Consult Pain Medication Reviews**: Look for reviews or guidelines that specifically address pain management in diabetic patients. These resources often provide insights into the best practices for prescribing pain medications to individuals with diabetes.

4. **Consider Patient-Specific Factors**: Take into account the patient's overall health, any other medical conditions, and their current diabetes management plan. This personalized approach will help in selecting the most suitable pain medication.

5. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consult with a healthcare provider or pharmacist who specializes in diabetes care and pain management. They can provide tailored recommendations based on the latest research and clinical guidelines.

By following these steps, you can effectively narrow your search and find appropriate pain management options for a patient with Type 2 diabetes.","Diabetes and Sick Days: What Meds are OK
					Pain and fever reducers
					Examples: Tylenol, Aspirin
					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Use cautiously if you have renal disease.

					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Also should be used carefully if you have renal disease."
"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Physician: Thank you for sharing your history. While you are a non-smoker, exposure to secondhand smoke can indeed have health implications. Research suggests that passive smoking may contribute to various health issues, including eye conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Your work environment, where you were exposed to tobacco smoke, could potentially be a risk factor for developing early AMD, especially considering the lack of proper ventilation.

Additionally, being Caucasian may also play a role, as certain populations have a higher predisposition to AMD. It's important to consider all these factors, including your genetic profile, when evaluating your risk. I recommend discussing this further with your eye care specialist, who can provide more personalized insights and management options for your condition.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Yes, conception is a requirement for a molar pregnancy. A molar pregnancy, also known as a hydatidiform mole, occurs after the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon, resulting in the formation of a zygote. This process of conception must take place for a molar pregnancy to develop. Molar pregnancies can occur when there is abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue following conception, leading to the characteristic swelling of the chorionic villi and elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If you have further questions or concerns about this condition, please feel free to ask.","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about the symptoms you're experiencing, especially since they can overlap between conditions like hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and arthritis. HNPP can cause issues such as swelling, soreness, and stiffness in the hands due to nerve involvement, which might be mistaken for arthritis. 

In HNPP, symptoms can include decreased motor nerve conduction velocities and manifestations like segmental demyelination, which could lead to the discomfort you're feeling. It's important to differentiate between the two conditions, as the management and treatment strategies may differ significantly. 

I recommend discussing your symptoms in detail with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your nerve function and possibly conduct nerve conduction studies to help clarify the diagnosis. This way, we can ensure that you receive the most appropriate treatment for your condition.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."

				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","It sounds like your wife is experiencing several concerning symptoms related to her diagnosis of giant cell vasculitis. The coffee ground vomiting you mentioned is indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur due to various reasons, including the presence of coagulated blood in the vomit. This symptom should be evaluated promptly by her healthcare provider, as it may require immediate attention.

The swelling in her feet and legs, known as peripheral edema, can be associated with various conditions, including heart issues or fluid overload, which may also be related to her vasculitis. Additionally, the migraines and facial swelling could be manifestations of her condition, as vasculitis can affect blood vessels and lead to inflammation in various parts of the body.

Given the complexity of her symptoms and the potential for serious complications, I strongly recommend that you contact her healthcare team as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms in detail. They may need to perform further evaluations, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to determine the underlying causes and appropriate treatment options. Please ensure she receives the care she needs.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.. GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

					Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis."
can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"To determine if you have a genetic form of Fibromyalgia, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Genetic Testing**: Consult with a genetic counselor or a specialist who can guide you on the appropriate genetic tests. These tests can analyze your DNA for any genetic alterations that may be associated with Fibromyalgia or other related conditions.

2. **Family History**: Discuss your family medical history with your healthcare provider. If there are other family members with Fibromyalgia or similar chronic pain conditions, it may suggest a genetic component.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in chronic pain can help assess your symptoms in the context of your genetic background and any chromosomal abnormalities identified in your blood work.

4. **Research and Clinical Trials**: Look for ongoing research studies or clinical trials that focus on the genetic aspects of Fibromyalgia. Participating in such studies may provide more insights into the genetic factors involved.

5. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest research on Fibromyalgia and genetics, as this is an evolving field. New findings may provide more clarity on the genetic links to this condition.

By following these steps, you can gain a better understanding of whether there is a genetic basis for your Fibromyalgia diagnosis.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"Physician: It's important to discuss any changes to your hormone replacement therapy, including stopping the estradiol patch, with your healthcare provider. Since you've only been on it for 4.5 months, we should consider the reasons for your treatment, your current symptoms, and any potential withdrawal effects. Let's review your situation and determine the best course of action together.","Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system

"Ear Wax.. 
				I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Using hydrogen peroxide in the ear can help to soften and break down earwax, making it easier to remove. However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Concentration**: Ensure that you are using a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide (typically around 3% is safe for use in the ear). Higher concentrations can be irritating and may cause damage to the ear canal.

2. **Frequency**: Regular use of hydrogen peroxide can lead to irritation or dryness in the ear canal. It's best to use it sparingly and not as a routine practice.

3. **Existing Conditions**: If you have any existing ear conditions, such as a perforated eardrum, otitis externa, or any other ear infections, you should avoid using hydrogen peroxide and consult a healthcare professional.

4. **Technique**: When using hydrogen peroxide, ensure that you are not forcing it into the ear canal. Allow it to bubble and work for a few minutes, then gently flush with warm water. Avoid using excessive force when flushing.

5. **Consultation**: If you experience pain, discomfort, or if the earwax buildup persists, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment, such as ear irrigation or manual removal.

In summary, while using hydrogen peroxide can be effective for earwax removal, it should be done cautiously and not as a regular practice without professional guidance.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most
					effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment."
"Sevoflurane. 
				I work in a hospital, and a question recently came up regarding the stability of Sevoflurane once it has been opened. Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","Physician: Sevoflurane, like many medical products, has a specific expiration date assigned by the manufacturer. This date indicates the time until which the product is expected to retain its properties and effectiveness. Once opened, the stability of Sevoflurane can be affected by various factors, including exposure to air and light. Therefore, it is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding the use of Sevoflurane after opening. Typically, the product should be used within a certain timeframe after opening to ensure its efficacy and safety. Always refer to the product's labeling for specific instructions on stability and expiration after opening.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride). In rats, this emulsion was an effective anesthetic and was not associated with adverse events. The emulsion was stable after consecutive evaluation for 365 days and for 180
					minutes after the vial was opened.. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium
					alloy."
"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral disorder that typically develops in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior towards authority figures. Unlike conduct disorder, individuals with ODD do not usually exhibit aggressive behaviors, destruction of property, theft, or deceit. Common symptoms include a negative or agitated mood, quarrelsome attitude, and vengefulness.

ODD can co-occur with other disorders, such as Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It's important to recognize that while ODD involves defiance and opposition, it does not typically involve the more severe behaviors seen in conduct disorder.

If you have any specific questions or need further information about ODD, its symptoms, treatment options, or how it may affect daily life, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic condition characterized by a range of physical manifestations and potential health complications. The primary features of BWS include:

1. **Umbilical Hernia**: A protrusion of tissue through the abdominal wall at the site of the umbilical cord.
2. **Macroglossia**: An enlarged tongue, which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.
3. **Gigantism**: Individuals with BWS often exhibit excessive growth, with growth patterns that may parallel or exceed the 95th percentile for their age.

In addition to these primary manifestations, BWS may also present with secondary features such as:

- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of internal organs.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar levels, which can be a serious concern, especially in infants.
- **Ear Abnormalities**: Various ear-related issues may be observed.

BWS is associated with certain genetic markers, including mutations in the **CDKN1C gene** and alterations in the **H19**, **KCNQ1OT1**, and **IGF2 genes**. These genetic factors contribute to the syndrome's characteristics and may also increase the risk of associated conditions such as **hepatoblastoma** (a type of liver cancer) and **gonadoblastoma** (a tumor that can occur in the gonads).

The syndrome is classified under congenital, familial, and genetic disorders, and it is considered an imprinting disorder due to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression from one parent. 

If you have specific questions about the management, diagnosis, or implications of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."
"CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.. 
				CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.
				Does ciprofaxin work well? Is there a better drug if so what.","Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that may be effective against various bacterial infections, including those caused by Escherichia coli. However, its effectiveness against Citrobacter freundii can vary, as this bacterium may exhibit antibiotic resistance. 

If ciprofloxacin is not effective or if there are concerns about resistance, alternative treatment options may include other antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or meropenem, depending on the susceptibility profile of the specific strain of Citrobacter freundii. It's essential to perform susceptibility testing to determine the most effective antibiotic for treatment. 

In summary, while ciprofloxacin may work for some infections, consulting with a healthcare provider for the best treatment option based on susceptibility testing is advisable.","There are no comparative studies of antibiotic therapy for Citrobacter infections. Thus, treatment of Citrobacter infections follows the principles for treatment of other Enterobacteriaceae infections. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities described above,
					aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and the fourth-generation cephems, such as cefepime and cefpirome, would appear to be preferred therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections.. Citrobacter species are a common cause of nosocomial infections associated with patients that are undergoing prolonged hospital treatments. C. freundii has recently been reported to express resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotincs including piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam,
					vancomycin and cephalosporins. Isolation of ceftriaxone-resistant Citrobacter freundii (CRCF) has been associated with the overprescribed broad spectrum antibiotics.. The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins."

Dr. Does not has any concerns about it. Thanks.","It sounds like your toddler may benefit from an evaluation by a specialist who can assess his posture and any potential musculoskeletal issues. Given the history of prolonged car seat use and the development of a flat head (which could be related to plagiocephaly), it would be advisable to consult a pediatric physical therapist or a pediatric orthopedic specialist. 

These professionals can evaluate his posture, sitting position, and any other concerns you have regarding his back. They can provide guidance on exercises, stretches, or interventions that may help improve his posture and prevent further issues. If you have concerns about his developmental milestones or overall motor skills, a pediatrician specializing in developmental disorders may also be helpful. 

It's important to advocate for your child's health, so if you feel that your concerns are not being addressed, seeking a second opinion from a specialist is a good step.","The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and

reaction to these 2 drugs. I would like to know if there are any drug reaction between Carvedilol 25 mg to Hydrslazine50 mg,"The physician should be aware that both carvedilol and hydralazine are antihypertensive agents, which means they both lower blood pressure. When used together, there is a potential for additive effects on blood pressure, which could lead to hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure). 

Additionally, carvedilol has contraindications with hypotension, so if the patient is already on hydralazine, careful monitoring of blood pressure is essential to avoid adverse effects. It is also important to consider the patient's overall health status and any other medications they may be taking to assess the risk of drug interactions.

In summary, while there is no direct drug interaction reported between carvedilol and hydralazine, their combined effects on blood pressure should be closely monitored to prevent hypotension.","In addition, carvedilol produced a slight but significant inhibition of the pressor responses to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), which was nearly identical in magnitude to that seen with hydralazine..

Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic that can cause side effects such as dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation, while Phentermine is a stimulant that may lead to increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and anxiety. Both medications can have anticholinergic effects, which may lead to complications, especially in patients with certain conditions.

Additionally, Phentermine is contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular diseases, and Dicyclomine is contraindicated in conditions like intestinal obstruction and myasthenia gravis. Mixing these medications could potentially exacerbate side effects or lead to unexpected interactions.

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have genetic components, but it is not solely passed down through genes. Certain types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, may have hereditary factors that increase the risk of developing the condition. However, dementia can also occur due to a variety of other factors, including environmental influences, lifestyle choices, and other health conditions. Therefore, while genetics can play a role, it is possible for anyone to develop dementia regardless of their family history.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease
					are not inherited."
"sleep apnea.  Is there a ""sleep apnea surgery"". I've heard that there is , but have never found a doctor that does this. My husband has been on C-pap for two years but has not been able to keep it on for more then 2 hours. He is not overweight, has had a stroke at 40 years old and double by-pass at
				50 years old. Otherwise he follows doctors orders and has no other problems. Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options available for treating sleep apnea, particularly if other treatments like CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) are not effective. One common surgical procedure is called palatopharyngoplasty, which involves removing excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway. This can help alleviate obstructive sleep apnea by reducing the obstruction that occurs during sleep.

Given your husband's medical history, including his stroke and heart surgery, it's essential to consult with a specialist in sleep medicine or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor) who can evaluate his specific situation and determine the most appropriate treatment options. They can also discuss the potential risks and benefits of surgery in his case. It's important to find a healthcare provider who is experienced in treating sleep apnea and can guide you through the available options.","Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP. Proper patient and procedure selection is critical to successful surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your Ear,

Diahrrea . I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea. Then I stop it for about 2 days so I can have a bowel movement. But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge when managing chronic diarrhea with loperamide. While loperamide can help reduce diarrhea by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and increasing fluid absorption, it can also lead to issues like soft stools or difficulty with bowel movements if used continuously.

To find a happy medium, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adjust Dosage**: You might need to adjust the dosage of loperamide. Instead of taking it continuously, you could try a lower dose on days when your symptoms are less severe and increase it as needed during flare-ups.

2. **Scheduled Dosing**: Instead of taking loperamide as needed, you could establish a regular schedule that allows for some bowel movement while still managing diarrhea. This might help regulate your stool consistency.

3. **Dietary Changes**: Pay attention to your diet. Certain foods can exacerbate diarrhea, while others can help firm up stools. Incorporating more soluble fiber (like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) can help improve stool consistency.

4. **Hydration**: Ensure you're staying well-hydrated, especially if you're experiencing diarrhea. Dehydration can worsen symptoms and lead to complications.

5. **Consult a Specialist**: If you're finding it difficult to manage your symptoms, it may be beneficial to consult a gastroenterologist. They can provide tailored advice and may suggest alternative treatments or therapies.

6. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep a diary of your symptoms, bowel movements, and any dietary changes. This can help you and your physician identify patterns and triggers.

It's important to communicate openly with your healthcare provider about your experiences and any side effects you're encountering. They can help you find the best approach to manage your chronic diarrhea effectively.","IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule
					Chronic Diarrhea
					Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may
					then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
					The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further
					administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered."
"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Yes, uveitis can be associated with autoimmune diseases. It is an inflammatory disorder of the eye that may occur as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues, which is characteristic of autoimmune conditions. Therefore, while uveitis itself is not classified solely as an autoimmune disease, it can be a manifestation of underlying autoimmune disorders.","Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue

How much urine does an average human bladder hold - in ounces?,"The average human bladder can hold about 16 to 24 ounces of urine, which is approximately 500 to 700 milliliters. However, individual capacity can vary based on factors such as age, hydration levels, and overall health.","Normal functional bladder capacity in adults ranges from approximately 300 to 400 ml (58,59).. A healthy bladder can hold one and a half to two cups (300-400mls) of urine during the day and about four cups (800mls) at night. It is normal to pass urine five or six times a day if you drink between 6-8 glasses of fluid. It is usual to empty your bladder when you get out of bed in the

Amlodipine. I am taking Amlodipine and it has caused my pause rate to be very high. Is there a weaning process when you stop taking Amlodipine and start atenolol? I am taking 5 mg of amlodipine and will be taking 50 mg of atenolol?,"When transitioning from amlodipine to atenolol, it's important to consider the weaning process carefully. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can lower blood pressure, while atenolol is a beta-blocker that also has a blood pressure-lowering effect. 

Since you are experiencing a high pause rate, it is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider about the best approach to tapering off amlodipine. Generally, a gradual reduction in dosage may be recommended to minimize any potential withdrawal effects or exacerbation of your condition. 

Your physician will likely monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely during this transition. They may suggest a specific weaning schedule based on your individual health needs and response to the medications. Always follow your physician's guidance when making changes to your medication regimen.","Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks. Do not abruptly discontinue without physician's advice.. If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks, do not suddenly stop using it. Stopping suddenly may cause your chest pain or high blood pressure to come back or get worse. Check with your doctor for the best way to reduce gradually the amount you are taking before

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"Dear Patient,

Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. It's understandable to feel worried after such an incident. 

In terms of HIV transmission, exposure to blood is one of the potential pathways through which the virus can be transmitted. However, the risk of HIV transmission depends on several factors, including the HIV status of the person whose blood you were exposed to, the amount of blood, and the nature of the exposure (e.g., whether there were any open wounds or mucous membrane contact).

Since you mentioned that you had blood splashed on your hands and face, and that you did not wash it off immediately, there is a potential risk, especially if there were any cuts or abrasions on your skin. However, the risk of transmission through intact skin is very low.

I recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional as soon as possible. They may suggest getting tested for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens, especially if you are feeling anxious about it. Early testing and intervention can provide peace of mind and necessary care if needed.

Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek medical advice.

Best regards.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."
Swan NDC 0869-0871-43. I found 4 cases of expired (04/2010) Hydrogen Peroxide. How do I safely dispose of this product?,"To safely dispose of expired hydrogen peroxide, you should follow these steps:

1. **Check Local Regulations**: Before disposal, check your local regulations regarding hazardous waste disposal, as hydrogen peroxide can be considered hazardous in certain concentrations.

2. **Dilution**: If the hydrogen peroxide is in a low concentration (typically 3% or less), you can dilute it with water. This can help reduce its potency.

3. **Disposal in Household Waste**: After dilution, you can pour the solution down the sink or toilet, followed by running water to help it dilute further. This is generally acceptable for small amounts.

4. **Hazardous Waste Facility**: For larger quantities or higher concentrations, take the hydrogen peroxide to a local hazardous waste disposal facility. They have the proper means to handle and dispose of such substances safely.

5. **Do Not Mix**: Avoid mixing hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals, especially those that are acidic or alkaline, as this can create dangerous reactions.

6. **Labeling**: If you are transporting the hydrogen peroxide to a disposal facility, ensure it is in a clearly labeled container to inform handlers of its contents.

Always prioritize safety and environmental considerations when disposing of chemicals.",Hydrogen peroxide solutions can be disposed of with no special treatment. You can safely pour them down the drain of a sink or into a toilet.
congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is primarily caused by embryologic defects in the diaphragm, which can lead to the protrusion of abdominal structures into the thorax. The exact causes of CDH can vary and may include genetic factors, environmental influences, and other congenital abnormalities. It can be isolated or associated with syndromic conditions or chromosome abnormalities.

Regarding cousin marriage, it can increase the risk of congenital disorders, including CDH, due to the potential for inherited genetic factors. However, the specific contribution of cousin marriage to the risk of CDH would depend on the genetic background of the families involved.

As for lung diseases, babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia often experience associated pulmonary hypoplasia, which is a condition where the lung parenchyma is underdeveloped. This can lead to long-term respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. The severity of these lung diseases can vary based on the extent of the hypoplasia and the effectiveness of medical and surgical interventions.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","When it comes to handling food in a workplace setting, it's important to consider the implications of shingles (herpes zoster). Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. While shingles itself is not directly transmitted through food, the virus can be present in the fluid of the blisters that develop on the skin.

If someone in the workplace has shingles, especially if they have active lesions, it is advisable to take precautions to prevent any potential risk of transmission. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Individuals with shingles should avoid direct contact with food and food preparation areas until their lesions have crusted over and are no longer infectious.

2. **Hygiene Practices**: Good hygiene practices should be followed, including frequent handwashing and using gloves when handling food, especially if there is any risk of contact with lesions.

3. **Workplace Policies**: It may be beneficial for the workplace to have policies in place regarding illness and food safety, ensuring that employees with contagious conditions are aware of the need to stay away from food handling until they are no longer contagious.

4. **Consult Health Guidelines**: Refer to local health guidelines or consult with a healthcare professional for specific recommendations regarding food safety and handling in the presence of shingles.

By following these precautions, the risk of any potential transmission can be minimized, ensuring a safe environment for food handling.","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."

				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","Physician: Thank you for your question and for sharing your experience. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is indeed a complex autoimmune disorder that primarily affects women, particularly during their reproductive years. This may contribute to a perception that it receives less attention in research compared to other conditions. However, APS can affect anyone, including men, and it is associated with serious complications such as thrombosis and pregnancy-related issues.

The relative lack of research funding and attention may also stem from the challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms of APS and the variability in how it presents in different individuals. While there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, there is still much to learn about the condition, including potential cures.

It's important to advocate for more research and awareness, as every patient's experience is valuable in understanding and addressing this disorder. If you're interested, I can help you find ongoing clinical trials or research studies that focus on APS, which could provide more insights and potential treatment options.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is often recommended to be taken in the evening because cholesterol synthesis in the liver is typically higher at night. Taking it in the evening can enhance its effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol. While taking simvastatin in the morning may not cause harm, it may not provide the same level of cholesterol-lowering benefits as taking it in the evening. It's important to follow your physician's recommendations regarding the timing of this medication for optimal results.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."
"Prednisone	. My husband has been on Prednisone for almost a year for a Cancer treatment he had. He started at 30mg and stayed on 10mg until a couple weeks ago. The prednisone was causing other side effects. He reduced down to 5mg for a couple days and now has been off the prednisone for a week. How
				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","It's important to understand that prednisone can have a significant impact on the body, especially after long-term use. Since your husband has been on prednisone for almost a year, it's possible that he may experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping the medication, which can include chills, fever, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can be part of what is known as steroid withdrawal syndrome, which occurs when the body is adjusting to the absence of the drug.

The duration that prednisone stays in the system can vary based on several factors, including the dosage, duration of use, and individual metabolism. Generally, prednisone has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours, but its effects can last longer, especially after prolonged use. It may take several days to weeks for the body to fully adjust after stopping the medication.

In terms of what to expect, withdrawal symptoms can vary widely among individuals. Some common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, body aches, and mood changes. It's crucial to monitor your husband's symptoms closely and consult with his healthcare provider, especially if the symptoms worsen or do not improve. The physician may recommend a gradual tapering of the dose rather than stopping abruptly to minimize withdrawal effects.

If your husband is experiencing severe symptoms or if you have concerns about his health, please seek medical attention promptly.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug. If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your
					body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics
			. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',
				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great that you're looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, especially considering your history of being active. However, managing asthma while exercising can be challenging, and it's important to choose the right types of activities to minimize the risk of triggering symptoms like dyspnea (difficulty breathing).

Here are some exercise recommendations for individuals with asthma, particularly those who are overweight:

1. **Aerobic Exercises**: Low-impact aerobic activities can be beneficial. Consider options like walking, swimming, or cycling at a moderate pace. These activities can help improve cardiovascular fitness without putting too much strain on your lungs.

2. **Controlled Breathing Techniques**: Incorporating breathing exercises can help you manage your asthma symptoms. Techniques such as pursed-lip breathing or diaphragmatic breathing can improve your lung function and help you feel more in control during physical activity.

3. **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always start with a gentle warm-up to prepare your body for exercise and finish with a cool-down to help your body recover. This can help reduce the likelihood of asthma symptoms.

4. **Avoid Triggers**: Pay attention to environmental factors that may trigger your asthma, such as cold air, pollen, or pollution. On days when the weather is particularly challenging, consider indoor exercises.

5. **Consult with a Healthcare Provider**: Before starting any new exercise program, it's essential to consult with your physician or a respiratory therapist. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific condition and help you develop a safe exercise plan.

6. **Gradual Progression**: Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as your body adapts. Listen to your body and stop if you experience any symptoms of asthma.

7. **Consider Group Classes**: Joining a class designed for individuals with asthma can provide support and guidance. Look for classes that focus on low-impact aerobic exercises.

Remember, the key is to find activities that you enjoy and can do safely. With the right approach, you can manage your asthma while staying active and healthy.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey. Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle branch block is a form of heart block that occurs when the electrical stimulation of the heart ventricles is interrupted at one of the branches of the Bundle of His. This interruption prevents the simultaneous depolarization of the two ventricles, which can affect the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently.

Symptoms of bundle branch block can vary. Some individuals may experience no symptoms at all, while others might have symptoms such as:

- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain or discomfort

Diagnosis is often made through an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can reveal the characteristic patterns associated with bundle branch block.

Treatment for bundle branch block depends on the underlying cause and the presence of symptoms. If the block is asymptomatic and not causing any issues, it may not require treatment. However, if symptoms are present or if the block is associated with other heart conditions, treatment options may include:

- Medications to manage symptoms or underlying heart conditions
- Lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise modifications
- In some cases, a pacemaker may be recommended to help regulate the heart's electrical signals.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)"
general health. I have an infection in gums...dentist prescribed Cephalexin 500mg...Is this ok to take even though I am ALLERGIC TO PENICILLAN?,"Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which is structurally different from penicillin. However, there is a known co-occurrence of penicillin allergy and cephalexin allergy. This means that some individuals who are allergic to penicillin may also have an allergic reaction to cephalexin. 

Given your allergy to penicillin, it is important to discuss this with your dentist or physician before taking cephalexin. They may consider alternative antibiotics that are safer for you. Always inform your healthcare provider about any allergies you have to ensure your safety.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Physician: Yes, arrhythmias can occur after an ablation procedure, although the goal of ablation is to correct the underlying arrhythmia. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but many studies report success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for certain types of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.

Regarding your Holter monitor test results, a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21 is quite significant and concerning. A heart rate of 254 indicates a very rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), while a heart rate of 21 is extremely low (bradycardia). These fluctuations could suggest the presence of serious arrhythmias that may require further evaluation and management. It’s important to discuss these findings in detail with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil citrate, which is the same active ingredient found in Viagra. Both medications are classified as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and work by increasing the availability of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the body, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and improved blood flow to the penis, which helps in achieving and maintaining an erection.

However, you mentioned that Fildena is not FDA approved. This is an important consideration, as FDA approval ensures that a medication has been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Without this approval, there may be concerns regarding the quality, effectiveness, and safety of Fildena compared to Viagra.

If you're looking for alternatives to Viagra, it may be worth discussing other FDA-approved options with your healthcare provider. These could include other PDE5 inhibitors like tadalafil (Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra), which may also be covered by your insurance.

It's essential to consult with your physician before starting any new medication, especially one that is not FDA approved, to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your specific health needs.","Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications
					Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you
					to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.. Fildena contains Sildenafil Citrate, a common ingredient used in various leading branded ED pills like kamagra etc. and which are available over the counter. Sildenafil Citrate was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharma. Sildenafil
					Citrate helps treat erectile dysfunction (trouble having an erection). Helps a man have an erection or have a better erection with his penis during sex. It also treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in both men and women.

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While naltrexone is primarily known as an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorder, some studies have suggested that it may have potential benefits in treating various mood disorders, including depression.

To determine if there are specific clinical trials investigating the efficacy of low-dose naltrexone for severe depression, I recommend searching ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing or completed studies. You can look for trials that focus on ""low-dose naltrexone"" and ""severe depression"" to find relevant information about safety, efficacy, and dosage schedules.

If you have any specific criteria or details about the study you are interested in, please let me know, and I can assist you further!","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be transmitted through various means, depending on the type of hepatitis virus involved. The most common modes of transmission include:

1. **Hepatitis A**: This virus is typically spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, often due to poor sanitation or hygiene practices.

2. **Hepatitis B**: This virus is primarily transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, or vaginal secretions. Common routes include sexual intercourse, sharing needles, and from mother to child during childbirth.

3. **Hepatitis C**: Similar to Hepatitis B, it is mainly spread through blood-to-blood contact, often through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, though this is less common.

4. **Hepatitis D**: This virus only occurs in those infected with Hepatitis B, as it requires the Hepatitis B virus to replicate. It is transmitted in similar ways to Hepatitis B.

5. **Hepatitis E**: This virus is usually spread through the consumption of contaminated water, similar to Hepatitis A.

To reduce the risk of catching hepatitis, it is important to practice good hygiene, ensure safe food and water consumption, avoid sharing needles, and engage in safe sexual practices. Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and B, which can provide effective protection against these types.","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other
					injection drug equipment
					* Needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries

					HEPATITIS C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with blood of an infected person

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or Tinea cruris, is primarily characterized by itching, redness, and a rash in the groin area. While small lumps under the skin around the scrotum are not typical symptoms of jock itch, they could indicate other conditions, such as cysts or infections. It's important to monitor these lumps and any other symptoms you may have. If they persist, change, or are accompanied by pain or discomfort, I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

1. **Tietze's Syndrome**: This condition involves idiopathic painful swellings of the costal cartilages, particularly the second rib, and can mimic coronary artery disease. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy.

2. **Pleurisy**: This is the inflammation of the pleura, the lining of the lungs, which can cause sharp chest pain, especially when breathing deeply or coughing. Treatment typically involves addressing the underlying cause of the inflammation, such as infections, and may include pain relief medications.

3. **Musculoskeletal Pain**: Discomfort can stem from muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bones in the rib area. Treatment may involve rest, physical therapy, and pain management strategies.

4. **Strain of Intercostal Muscle**: This occurs due to trauma or overuse of the intercostal muscles, leading to pain in the chest wall. Treatment usually includes rest, ice application, and pain relief medications.

For effective management, it's essential to identify the specific cause of the rib cage pain. Consulting with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan is recommended.","Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
					Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
					Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis)
					Osteoporosis
					Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
					Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.

					Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain."

Appendicitis can occur without a significant elevation in body temperature. The presence of fever can vary among patients, and other symptoms such as abdominal pain and inflammation are also key indicators of the condition. If you have concerns about appendicitis or related symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main

Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to note the following:

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: There is a potential interaction between diclofenac (an NSAID) and lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor). NSAIDs can reduce the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and may increase the risk of kidney problems, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues or dehydration. Therefore, caution is advised when using these medications together.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and naproxen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Taking them together can increase the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and kidney damage. It is generally not recommended to use two NSAIDs simultaneously.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: There is no direct interaction between diclofenac and acetaminophen. They can be used together, but it is important to adhere to the recommended dosages for each medication to avoid potential liver damage from excessive acetaminophen use.

In summary, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before combining these medications to ensure safety and appropriate management of any potential interactions.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

					Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL

"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, also known as trisomy 13, is a genetic disorder that can lead to a variety of severe abnormalities. The progression of the condition can vary significantly among individuals. Generally, the prognosis for those with Patau syndrome is poor, and many affected individuals do not survive past infancy. For those who do survive, they may experience worsening symptoms over time, particularly related to developmental delays and physical abnormalities.

Diagnosis of Patau syndrome typically involves genetic testing, which can confirm the presence of an extra chromosome 13. This can be done through various methods, including karyotyping, which examines the number and structure of chromosomes, or through non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) during pregnancy. Physical examinations may also reveal characteristic features associated with the syndrome, such as microcephaly, polydactyly, and other structural defects.

If you have further questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!","Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed
					eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within
					their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year.. Clinical tests (28 available)

"quinine in seltzer water.. quinine in seltzer water.
				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct ""dosage""? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.","Yes, quinine can be used to help ease leg cramps, as it has been shown to have effects on muscle relaxation. However, it's important to note that the use of quinine for leg cramps should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as there are potential side effects and contraindications associated with its use.

As for the dosage, it is crucial to consult with your physician or healthcare provider to determine the appropriate amount for your specific situation. They can provide you with the correct dosage based on your health status and any other medications you may be taking. 

If you find the taste of quinine in seltzer water unpleasant, you might want to discuss alternative formulations or methods of administration with your healthcare provider.","Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

					The evidence is current to October 2014."
"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For the treatment of mite infestation, particularly conditions like scabies or other forms of acariasis, the following non-toxic or low-side-effect options are generally recommended:

1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: This is a common treatment for scabies and is generally well-tolerated. It is applied to the skin and left on for a specified period before washing off.
   - **Ivermectin**: This oral medication can be used in cases where topical treatments are not effective or feasible. It is considered safe and effective for treating scabies.

2. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Tea Tree Oil**: Known for its antimicrobial properties, tea tree oil may help alleviate symptoms and reduce mite populations. It should be diluted before application to avoid skin irritation.
   - **Neem Oil**: This natural oil has insecticidal properties and can be applied to the affected areas.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: 
   - Wash all clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water and dry them on a hot cycle to eliminate any mites.
   - Vacuum carpets and upholstered furniture to remove any potential mites.

4. **Preventive Measures**: 
   - Avoid close contact with infested individuals or animals.
   - Maintain good personal hygiene and keep living areas clean and dry.

5. **Consultation with a Healthcare Provider**: 
   - It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment options tailored to your specific situation, especially if you have concerns about side effects.

By following these recommendations, you can effectively manage mite infestations while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."
meds taken with wine at dinnertime. Is it safe to take my meds with wine at dinnertime?,"It is generally not safe to take medications with alcohol, including wine, as it can lead to drug-alcohol interactions that may reduce the effectiveness of the medication or increase the risk of adverse effects. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider about the specific medications you are taking and their potential interactions with alcohol. Please provide the names of your medications for a more tailored response.","Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can
					make it dangerous to drive, and when you mix alcohol with certain medicines you put yourself at even greater risk. Combining alcohol with some medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries, especially among older people."

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Inadequate Feeding**: Newborns may not receive enough breast milk or formula, leading to low blood sugar levels.
2. **Maternal Diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, the newborn may experience hypoglycemia after birth due to high insulin levels.
3. **Prematurity**: Premature infants may have immature metabolic systems, making them more susceptible to low blood sugar.
4. **Infection or Illness**: Newborns with infections or other health issues may have difficulty maintaining normal blood glucose levels.
5. **Low Birth Weight**: Infants with low birth weight may have less glycogen stores, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Regular Prenatal Care**: Attend all prenatal appointments to monitor the health of both mother and baby.
2. **Manage Diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, it is crucial to manage blood sugar levels effectively throughout the pregnancy.
3. **Balanced Nutrition**: Maintain a well-balanced diet rich in nutrients to support fetal growth and development.
4. **Monitor Fetal Movements**: Be aware of fetal movements and report any significant changes to a healthcare provider.
5. **Educate on Feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed adequately and frequently, especially in the first few days.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, a CT scan can detect both diverticulitis and diverticulosis even in the absence of an active infection. Diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of multiple diverticula in the walls of the intestine, which can be visualized on a CT scan. Diverticulitis, on the other hand, involves inflammation of these diverticula, and while it may not show signs of infection at the time, the inflammation and any associated changes in the bowel can still be identified through imaging. Therefore, a CT scan is a useful diagnostic tool for assessing both conditions.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by colds while others are not can be attributed to several factors, including individual immune responses and disease susceptibility. 

1. **Immune Response**: Each person's immune system reacts differently to pathogens, including the viruses that cause colds. A strong immune response can help prevent infection or reduce the severity of symptoms. Factors such as genetics, overall health, and previous exposure to similar viruses can influence how effectively a person's immune system responds.

2. **Disease Susceptibility**: Some individuals may have a constitution or condition that makes them more susceptible to infections. This can be due to various factors, including underlying health conditions, age, and environmental exposures. For example, people with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses may be more prone to catching colds.

3. **Contagion and Exposure**: While contagion plays a significant role in the transmission of cold viruses, not everyone who is exposed will become infected. Factors such as the viral load (the amount of virus present) and the duration of exposure can also impact whether someone gets sick.

In summary, the interplay between immune response, disease susceptibility, and exposure to the virus determines why some people catch colds while others do not.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg- 1 daily. Doctor prescribed for type 2 diabetes w/Metformin 500 mg 2 times daily. Pharmacy refused to fill stating overdose of Metformin. Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"The physician is correct in prescribing Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg once daily along with Metformin 500mg twice daily. However, the pharmacy's concern about a potential overdose of Metformin needs to be addressed.

The maximum recommended daily dosage of Metformin for adults is typically 2000 to 2500 mg, depending on the specific formulation and the patient's individual health circumstances. In this case, the patient is receiving 1000 mg from Janumet XR and an additional 1000 mg from Metformin (500 mg twice daily), totaling 2000 mg per day. This is within the acceptable range for Metformin dosage.

Therefore, the pharmacy's refusal to fill the prescription may be based on a misunderstanding of the total dosage being prescribed. The physician should clarify the prescription details with the pharmacy to ensure the patient receives the correct medication.",The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets are 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).
SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) typically occurs in children and young adults, usually 2-8 years after an initial measles infection. While it is rare, the condition is primarily associated with individuals who have had measles, particularly those who did not receive the measles vaccination. 

In your son's case, since he is 33 years old and did not have the measles vaccination, he may be at risk if he contracts measles. However, SSPE is most commonly diagnosed in younger individuals, and the likelihood of developing SSPE at this age is significantly lower compared to younger populations. 

It is important to note that SSPE can only develop after a measles infection, so if your son has never had measles, he would not be at risk for SSPE. However, if he were to contract measles in the future, there would be a potential risk for SSPE to develop years later. Vaccination is the best preventive measure against measles and its complications, including SSPE.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about your granddaughter's condition. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a complex vascular disorder that can lead to various symptoms, including limb overgrowth and vascular malformations. Since she is only 5 months old, it's crucial to work closely with a pediatric specialist who can provide tailored care.

Currently, treatment options for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome may include:

1. **Symptom Management**: This involves supportive care to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. It may include physical therapy to address mobility issues and strategies to manage any pain or discomfort.

2. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor her condition and any changes in her symptoms.

3. **Surgical Interventions**: In some cases, surgical options may be considered to address significant vascular malformations or to improve limb function.

4. **Vascular Treatments**: Depending on the specific symptoms, treatments such as sclerotherapy or laser therapy may be used to manage vascular lesions.

5. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Engaging a team of specialists, including pediatricians, vascular surgeons, and physical therapists, can provide comprehensive care.

I recommend looking into clinical trials that may be available for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, as they can offer access to new treatments and therapies. You can find information on ClinicalTrials.gov by searching for ""Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome."" Additionally, connecting with support groups or organizations focused on vascular malformations can provide valuable resources and community support.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."

How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"To determine the likelihood of child B passing on inherited ricketts to their offspring, we need to consider the mode of inheritance of the condition. If ricketts is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, then each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder, regardless of whether they are child A or child B. 

Since the mother has inherited ricketts, she would pass on the mutant allele with a 50% probability to each child. Therefore, if child B is not affected (assuming they do not carry the mutant allele), they would not pass it on to their children. However, if child B does carry the allele (even if they do not express the phenotype), they would also have a 50% chance of passing it on to their offspring.

In summary, if child B is unaffected and does not carry the allele, they cannot pass it on. If they do carry the allele, there is a 50% chance they would pass it on to their children.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."
"Medicare Part B coverage. I suffer with acute fibromyalgia (sp?) and the various drugs my doctor has prescribed for me have little if any effect in helping to control the pain. My doctor has since given me a prescription to have massage therapy which she thought medicare would cover. However, when checking with
				medicare, it turns out that it does not! Can you suggest any other type of treatment?","Given your situation with fibromyalgia and the limited effectiveness of your current medications, there are several alternative treatment options you might consider. 

1. **Pain Management Programs**: These programs take a comprehensive approach to managing chronic pain, including fibromyalgia. They often involve a combination of medication management, physical therapy, behavioral health treatment, and pain coping strategies. You might want to discuss enrolling in a pain management program with your physician.

2. **Alternative Therapies**: Since traditional medications have not been effective, exploring alternative therapies could be beneficial. This may include acupuncture, chiropractic care, or other complementary therapies that can help alleviate pain and improve your quality of life.

3. **Physical Therapy**: Engaging in a tailored physical therapy program can help improve your strength, flexibility, and overall function. A physical therapist can design a program specifically for your needs and help you manage your symptoms.

4. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This type of therapy can help you develop coping strategies for dealing with chronic pain and the emotional aspects of fibromyalgia, such as depression and anxiety.

5. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Incorporating regular low-impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, can help manage symptoms. Additionally, focusing on sleep hygiene and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or yoga, may also provide relief.

6. **Dietary Changes**: Some patients find that certain dietary adjustments can help manage their symptoms. Consulting with a nutritionist who understands fibromyalgia may provide insights into beneficial dietary changes.

It's important to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific needs.","What do we know about the effectiveness of complementary health approaches for fibromyalgia?

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR A1298C variant is a common genetic polymorphism that can affect folate metabolism and homocysteine levels in the body. Being homozygous for this variant (having two copies of the A1298C allele) may lead to reduced enzyme activity, which can impact various health aspects.

**Health Issues:**
1. **Hyperhomocysteinemia:** Individuals who are homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant may have elevated levels of homocysteine, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, and other health issues.
2. **Folate Deficiency:** This variant can impair the metabolism of folate, potentially leading to deficiencies that can affect pregnancy outcomes, neurological health, and overall well-being.
3. **Potential Association with Other Conditions:** Some studies suggest a link between MTHFR variants and conditions such as neural tube defects, certain cancers, and psychiatric disorders, although the evidence is not definitive.

**Long-term Prognosis:**
The long-term prognosis for individuals with homozygous MTHFR A1298C can vary widely based on lifestyle, dietary factors, and the presence of other risk factors. Here are some considerations:
- **Dietary Management:** Ensuring adequate intake of folate (through diet or supplementation) can help mitigate some risks associated with this variant.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Monitoring homocysteine levels and cardiovascular health may be beneficial for early intervention if levels are elevated.
- **Personalized Healthcare:** Individuals may benefit from personalized healthcare strategies that consider their genetic background, including potential lifestyle modifications and preventive measures.

In summary, while being homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant may pose certain health risks, proactive management and lifestyle choices can significantly influence long-term health outcomes. It is advisable for individuals with this genetic profile to work closely with healthcare providers to monitor their health and address any potential issues.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can lead to various side effects, including gastrointestinal issues like flatulence. While flatulence is not the most common side effect associated with Vitamin D supplementation, it can occur in some individuals, particularly if they have sensitivities or if the supplement is taken in conjunction with other medications or dietary changes.

Regarding safety, such high doses of Vitamin D are typically prescribed for individuals with significantly low levels of Vitamin D, but they should be monitored by a healthcare professional. It's essential to ensure that the dosage is appropriate for your specific situation, as excessive Vitamin D can lead to toxicity, resulting in hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood) and other health issues. Regular monitoring of Vitamin D levels and calcium levels is advisable when taking high doses to ensure safety and effectiveness. Always consult with your physician before making any changes to your Vitamin D intake.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To prevent a shingles outbreak, the most effective method is vaccination. The shingles vaccine is designed to boost your immune response against the varicella-zoster virus, which causes both chickenpox and shingles. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Vaccination**: The shingles vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those over the age of 50, as the risk of developing shingles increases with age. There are two main types of vaccines: Zostavax (a live attenuated vaccine) and Shingrix (a recombinant vaccine), with Shingrix being the preferred option due to its higher efficacy.

2. **Immune System Health**: Maintaining a healthy immune system can help reduce the risk of shingles. This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and managing stress.

3. **Avoiding Triggers**: Some individuals may find that certain stressors or illnesses can trigger a shingles outbreak. Identifying and managing these triggers can be beneficial.

4. **Consulting with a Healthcare Provider**: If you have a history of chickenpox or are concerned about shingles, discussing vaccination options with your healthcare provider can help you make an informed decision.

By taking these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce your risk of experiencing a shingles outbreak.","How Can You Reduce Your Risk of Getting Shingles?
					Vaccination is the only way to reduce your risk of shingles and PHN. CDC recommends adults age 60 years or older receive a single dose of shingles vaccine. Zostavax'ae is the only shingles vaccine currently available. It is available by prescription from a healthcare professional. Talk with your doctor or
					pharmacist if you have questions about the shingles vaccine."

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and cysts, especially with your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While I cannot provide specific statistics without more context, I can share that thyroid tumors, particularly those greater than 1 cm, are monitored closely due to the potential risk of malignancy. 

Thyroid cancer is relatively common, and the prognosis is generally favorable, especially for well-differentiated types like papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. Your endocrinologist will be the best resource for monitoring your condition and determining the appropriate next steps based on the characteristics of your tumor and cysts.

It's also important to maintain regular follow-ups and imaging as recommended by your healthcare provider. If you have specific concerns about your risk factors or the implications of CVID on your thyroid health, discussing these with your endocrinologist can provide you with tailored information and reassurance.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the
					development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival over the 4

diabete. whats diabete,"Diabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a group of disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and glucose intolerance. There are different types of diabetes, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1), which is caused by insulin deficiency and can lead to severe hyperglycemia and complications if not treated with insulin. It's important to monitor blood glucose levels to manage the condition effectively. Would you like to know more about the types of diabetes or how to manage it?","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."
wellbutrin xl 150. how to taper off,"When tapering off Wellbutrin XL (bupropion), it's important to do so gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms and ensure a smooth transition. Here are some general steps you can follow, but please consult your physician for a personalized tapering plan:

1. **Consult Your Physician**: Before making any changes to your medication regimen, discuss your plans with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance based on your specific situation.

2. **Create a Tapering Schedule**: Your physician may recommend a tapering schedule that gradually reduces your dosage. This could involve decreasing the dose by 50 mg every few weeks, but the exact plan will depend on your current dosage and how long you've been taking the medication.

3. **Monitor Symptoms**: As you taper, keep track of any withdrawal symptoms or changes in mood. Common symptoms can include irritability, anxiety, or changes in sleep patterns.

4. **Adjust as Needed**: If you experience significant withdrawal symptoms, your physician may suggest slowing down the tapering process or adjusting the dosage further.

5. **Support**: Consider seeking support from a therapist or support group during this process, as emotional support can be beneficial when discontinuing antidepressants.

Remember, the goal is to taper off safely and comfortably, so maintaining open communication with your healthcare provider is crucial throughout this process.","1. he tapered off bupropion SR, taking 150 mg/day for 4 days followed by 150 mg every other day for 8 days (4 total doses) and 150 mg every third day for 6 days (2 total doses) without further complications.

Chronic cervicitis, even if not caused by a bacterial infection, can still have implications for fertility. Inflammation of the cervix can affect the cervical mucus, which plays a crucial role in sperm transport and can create an environment that is less favorable for conception.

"trisomy 7. trisomy 7. i am a 32 y/o who has had 4 miscarriages in the past 19 months. Upon my last DNC two weeks ago revealed a genetics study diagnosis of the baby having trisomy 7. could you offer me any information on this? could this have been maternal or paternal? is this something i would be
				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Trisomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 7 in somatic cells. It can be associated with various diseases, particularly certain types of adenomas in the thyroid and renal tissues, as well as sporadic breast carcinoma. 

Regarding your situation, the occurrence of trisomy 7 in your pregnancies could be due to a random error during cell division, which is often the case with chromosomal abnormalities. It is not typically inherited from parents, but rather arises sporadically. However, advanced maternal age can be a contributing factor to chromosomal abnormalities, as the risk of such errors increases with age.

As for whether you could be a carrier, it is unlikely that you would be a carrier of trisomy 7 in the traditional sense, as this condition usually arises from nondisjunction during meiosis, leading to an extra chromosome in the embryo rather than being passed down from a parent. Genetic studies can provide more insight into your specific situation, including whether there are any underlying genetic factors that might contribute to recurrent miscarriages.

If you have had multiple miscarriages, it may be beneficial to discuss with a genetic counselor or a specialist in reproductive genetics. They can help you understand the implications of the trisomy diagnosis and explore any potential genetic testing that could provide further information about your reproductive health.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."

Regarding cataract surgery, aclidinium is contraindicated in patients with drug hypersensitivity, but there is no specific mention of it being contraindicated for patients who may need cataract surgery. However, it is always best to consult with an ophthalmologist or healthcare provider to assess any potential interactions or complications related to the use of aclidinium and upcoming surgical procedures.","1. Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.

					2. There are currently six muscarinic receptor antagonists licenced for use in the treatment of COPD, the short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMAs) ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) aclidinium bromide, tiotropium
					bromide, glycopyrronium bromide and umeclidinium bromide. Concerns have been raised about possible associations of muscarinic receptor antagonists with cardiovascular safety, but the most advanced compounds seem to have an improved safety profile.

					3. The use of TUDORZA PRESSAIR is contraindicated in the following conditions:
					*Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] *Hypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"
intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine can have several detrimental effects on digestion and absorption in the body. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which can reduce blood flow to the intestines. This decreased circulation can impair the digestive process and hinder the absorption of nutrients.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. It may lead to increased gastric acid secretion and alter the normal peristaltic movements, potentially causing issues such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or constipation.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may interfere with the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and other glands, which are essential for breaking down food and facilitating absorption.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smokers are at a higher risk for developing gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease, which can further complicate digestion and absorption.

5. **Nutrient Absorption**: Smoking can impair the absorption of certain nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. For example, it has been associated with lower levels of vitamin C and calcium in the body.

6. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can negatively affect the composition of gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in digestion and absorption. An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to digestive issues and affect overall health.

In summary, smoking and nicotine can disrupt the normal processes of digestion and absorption, leading to various gastrointestinal issues and nutrient deficiencies. It is advisable for individuals to consider these effects when evaluating their smoking habits and overall health.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa."
sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Yes, swelling can occur in individuals with fibromyalgia, although it is not one of the primary symptoms of the condition. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, and while it typically does not cause significant swelling, some patients may experience mild edema or swelling in their extremities, particularly if they are experiencing increased pain or inflammation. It's important to monitor the swelling, especially if it has started suddenly, as it could be related to other factors such as fluid retention or inflammation. If the swelling persists or worsens, I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment to further evaluate your symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action.","1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","It's understandable to be concerned about potential risks after an accidental needle stick injury, especially in the context of a cancer patient. However, cancer itself is not transmitted through blood contact or needle stick injuries. Malignant neoplasms, such as those your uncle has, do not spread from person to person like infectious diseases.

That said, if the needle used for the injection was contaminated with blood, there is a risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens, which can be transmitted through needle stick injuries. It's important to monitor for any signs of infection and consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. They may recommend testing or preventive measures based on the specifics of the incident. Please ensure you seek medical advice promptly.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities, especially if those activities are not appropriate for your age or physical condition. Engaging in high-impact activities or prolonged standing can increase stress on the plantar fascia, leading to more pain and inflammation.

In addition to weight-bearing activities, other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper support or cushioning can exacerbate the condition.
2. **Overuse**: Repeatedly engaging in activities that put strain on the feet, such as running or jumping, can lead to increased symptoms.
3. **Biomechanical Imbalances**: Issues such as flat feet or high arches can contribute to the development and aggravation of plantar fasciitis.
4. **Obesity**: Excess weight can place additional stress on the plantar fascia.
5. **Inadequate Stretching**: Failing to properly stretch the calf muscles and plantar fascia can lead to tightness and increased pain.

If you are experiencing aggravation of your plantar fasciitis, it may be beneficial to modify your activities, use supportive footwear, and consider physical therapy to address any underlying biomechanical issues.","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can be detected during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) examination. The upper GI tract includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, and procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can be performed to visualize these areas. 

While the primary focus of an upper GI examination is on the structures within the upper gastrointestinal tract, imaging techniques can also help assess nearby lymph nodes for any abnormalities, including potential metastasis from liver cancer. Additionally, if there are indications of liver involvement, imaging methods can be utilized to evaluate the liver directly. 

If there are specific concerns about lymph nodes or liver cancer, further diagnostic procedures may be warranted to ensure accurate detection and assessment.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					anemia
					gastroesophageal reflux disease
					ulcers
					cancer
					inflammation, or swelling
					precancerous abnormalities

					2. Tests for Liver Cancer

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

					Lab tests"
abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"Yes, an abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious complications, including a heart attack. When a tooth becomes infected, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream, leading to a condition known as bacteremia. This can result in infections in other parts of the body, including the heart, which can cause endocarditis. Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart and can damage heart valves, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks. Therefore, it is important to treat dental infections promptly to prevent such complications.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Ischemic syncope refers to a temporary loss of consciousness due to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, often caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or other forms of cerebrovascular ischemia. A TIA is characterized by brief, reversible episodes of focal neurological dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours, typically less than one hour, due to transient thrombotic or embolic occlusion of blood vessels. 

In the context of stroke diagnoses, ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to a part of the brain is blocked, leading to tissue necrosis. This can be classified based on various factors, including the type of tissue affected, the location in the brain, and whether it is hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic. 

In summary, ischemic syncope can be a symptom or result of a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke, indicating a need for further evaluation and diagnosis to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Autoimmune illness. What doctor specializes in testing for and treatment of autoimmune illness?,"The physician who specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune illnesses is a Rheumatologist. Rheumatologists are experts in managing rheumatic diseases, which often include autoimmune conditions. They perform various diagnostic tests, such as antibody tests and imaging studies, to assess and treat these diseases effectively.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any

"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is known to potentially cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect. This occurs because venlafaxine is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which can affect neurotransmitter levels and lead to sexual side effects, including difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection.

The minimum amount of Effexor that may cause ED can vary significantly from person to person, as individual responses to medication can differ based on factors such as dosage, duration of use, and personal health conditions. There is no specific ""minimum"" dose established that guarantees the absence of ED, as some individuals may experience side effects at lower doses while others may not experience them even at higher doses.

If you are concerned about the effects of Effexor on your sexual health, it is important to discuss this with your physician. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and may consider adjusting your dosage or exploring alternative treatments if necessary.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"Physician: While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are primarily used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, there have been some studies suggesting a potential link between their use and erectile dysfunction (ED). The exact duration of this association is not well-defined, as it can vary based on individual health factors and the specific NSAID used. However, it is important to note that the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship. If you have concerns about NSAID use and its effects on erectile function, it may be beneficial to discuss alternative pain management options or further evaluation of your symptoms.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by a pathological constriction at the aortic valve, which restricts the outflow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. This can lead to various complications, including heart murmurs, which are sounds caused by the turbulent flow of blood through the heart. 

The aortic valve itself is crucial as it prevents backflow into the left ventricle. When aortic stenosis occurs, it can result in left ventricular hypertrophy, which is the enlargement of the left ventricle due to increased pressure load. This condition can significantly impact cardiac output, which is the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute.

Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath, especially during physical activity. It's important to monitor this condition closely, as it can lead to serious cardiovascular issues if left untreated. If you have any specific questions or concerns about aortic stenosis, feel free to ask!","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"Leukocytosis, which is a transient increase in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the body, can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:

1. **Infection**: The invasion of microorganisms or their toxins can lead to an increase in white blood cell count as the body responds to fight off the infection.

2. **Inflammation**: This pathological process, characterized by tissue injury or destruction, can also trigger an increase in leukocytes as part of the immune response.

3. **Stress**: Biological adaptation to stress can lead to elevated white blood cell counts as the body reacts to various stressors.

4. **Allergic Reactions**: An immune response to allergens can result in increased white blood cell production, particularly eosinophils, which are involved in allergic responses.

5. **Other Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell pain crisis or gastrointestinal bleeding, can also be clinically associated with leukocytosis.

If you have specific symptoms or concerns, it would be best to discuss them further for a more tailored evaluation.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
					Chronic myelogenous leukemia
					Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine
					Infections, bacterial or viral
