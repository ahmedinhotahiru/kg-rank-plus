Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases are both hereditary conditions, but they are distinct disorders with different genetic causes and manifestations. 

1. **Noonan Syndrome**: This is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by features such as short stature, webbed neck, ptosis, skeletal malformations, and various cardiac abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in several genes, with PTPN11 being the most common. Noonan syndrome can occur in both males and females and is classified as a syndromic renal or urinary tract malformation.

2. **Polycystic Kidney Diseases (PKD)**: These are hereditary diseases characterized by the progressive formation of numerous cysts in the kidneys. PKD can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. The condition leads to kidney dysfunction and can be associated with other systemic issues.

**Relation between Noonan Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Diseases**:
- Noonan syndrome is classified as a syndromic renal or urinary tract malformation, which means it can have renal manifestations, although it is not primarily a kidney disease like PKD.
- Both conditions can be inherited, with Noonan syndrome often following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, similar to some forms of polycystic kidney disease.

In summary, while Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases are separate entities, they can both involve renal abnormalities and share a genetic basis. If you have specific concerns about the relationship between these two conditions in a patient, further genetic counseling and evaluation may be beneficial.","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"Physician: If you have tested positive for the VDRL test, it is important to follow up with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. A positive VDRL test may indicate syphilis, but it can also yield false positives due to other conditions. Therefore, further testing, such as treponemal tests, is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.

In terms of precautions, it is essential to avoid sexual contact until you have been evaluated and treated, as syphilis is a contagious venereal disease. Additionally, informing any sexual partners about your positive test result is crucial so they can also get tested and treated if necessary. 

Make sure to discuss with your healthcare provider about the appropriate treatment options, which may include antibiotics like doxycycline. Regular follow-up appointments will also be important to monitor your condition and ensure effective treatment.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The effects of anesthesia on patients with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) can vary based on individual health conditions and the specifics of the procedure. Generally, anesthesia is administered to ensure that patients do not experience pain during surgery, such as a hip replacement. 

However, FXTAS is characterized by neurological symptoms, including intention tremor and ataxia, which may complicate anesthesia management. It is crucial for the surgical team to be aware of the patient's FXTAS diagnosis, as this may influence the choice of anesthetic agents and the overall approach to anesthesia. 

While anesthesia is generally safe, there is a potential for neurologic effects, especially in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions. It is essential to discuss any concerns with the anesthesiologist and the surgical team, who can tailor the anesthesia plan to minimize risks and ensure the patient's safety during the procedure. 

In summary, while anesthesia is necessary for a hip replacement, careful consideration and planning are required for FXTAS patients to mitigate any potential risks.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, Ocella, like other hormonal birth control methods, can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms your daughter is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, swelling in her thigh, and large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could be indicative of DVT or other complications. Given that these symptoms have worsened after childbirth, it is crucial for her to discuss this with her doctor as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is important to assess her condition and determine the appropriate course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","Given your history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and your allergies to penicillin and dairy products, it’s important to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective for UTIs and do not contain these allergens.

1. **Nitrofurantoin**: This is often used for uncomplicated UTIs and is generally well-tolerated. However, it may not be suitable if you have significant kidney issues.

2. **Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)**: This combination antibiotic is commonly prescribed for UTIs. Ensure you are not allergic to sulfa drugs before considering this option.

3. **Fosfomycin**: This is a single-dose antibiotic that can be effective for uncomplicated UTIs and may be a good option if you have recurrent infections.

4. **Ciprofloxacin**: While you have taken ciprofloxacin multiple times, if it has been effective in the past, it may be worth discussing with your doctor again, especially if they can monitor for resistance.

5. **Cefdinir or Cefpodoxime**: These are cephalosporins that may be suitable alternatives if you are not allergic to them.

Make sure to discuss these options with your doctor, as they can help determine the best course of action based on your medical history and current health status. Additionally, it may be beneficial to investigate the possibility of antibiotic resistance, as this could be contributing to the recurrence of your UTIs.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Streptococcal infections, particularly those caused by certain strains of Streptococcus, can lead to invasive diseases, but they are not directly linked to causing granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is primarily an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and granulomatous inflammation, particularly affecting the respiratory tract and kidneys.

While streptococcal infections can lead to serious complications, such as invasive streptococcal disease, they do not typically present with the same symptoms or pathological processes as granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, infections can sometimes trigger autoimmune reactions in predisposed individuals, which may lead to symptoms similar to those seen in autoimmune diseases. If you are experiencing symptoms that concern you, it is important to discuss them further with your healthcare provider for appropriate evaluation and management.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.

					Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease of unknown origin, although recent studies suggest that auto-immune mechanisms and infection play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. During follow-up, nasal carriage of Staphyloccocus Aureus could be documented. An overview of Wegener's
					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or ""group A strep."" This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is
					external).

					Severe Strep Infections

					Some types of group A strep bacteria cause severe infections, such as

					Bacteremia (bloodstream infections) - To learn more visit visit the MedlinePlus sepsis site (link is external).
					Toxic shock syndrome (multi-organ infection) - To learn more visit the MedlinePlus toxic shock syndrome site (link is external).
					Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) - To learn more visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention necrotizing fasciitis site (link is external).
					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

					Fever and chills
					Cough
					Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
					Chest pain
					Skin and soft-tissue infections often appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be:

					Red
					Swollen or painful
					Warm to the touch
					Full of pus or other drainage
					These skin infections may also be accompanied by a fever.

					Bone and joint infections often appear as pain in the infected area and might also include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Swelling
					Stiffness or inability to use affected limb or joint
					Rarely in adults, group B strep bacteria can cause meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord)."
"Diabetes and pain control. 
				How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.","To narrow your search for information regarding pain (joint) medication suitable for a person with Type 2 diabetes, consider the following steps:

1. **Focus on Analgesics**: Look for analgesics that are known to be safe for individuals with diabetes. Some common options include acetaminophen and certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but be cautious with NSAIDs as they can affect kidney function, which is a concern for diabetic patients.

2. **Check for Drug Interactions**: Investigate potential drug interactions between pain medications and any diabetes medications the patient may be taking. This is crucial to avoid adverse effects and ensure safe management of both diabetes and pain.

3. **Consult Pain Management Guidelines**: Look for guidelines or studies specifically addressing pain management in diabetic patients. These resources often provide recommendations on suitable medications and dosages.

4. **Consider Non-Pharmacological Approaches**: In addition to medication, explore non-pharmacological pain management techniques, such as physical therapy, exercise, or acupuncture, which may be beneficial for joint pain without affecting blood sugar levels.

5. **Patient Education**: Ensure that the patient is educated on self-management of pain and the importance of monitoring their blood sugar levels when starting any new medication.

By focusing on these areas, you can find relevant information that addresses the specific needs of a patient with Type 2 diabetes experiencing joint pain.","Diabetes and Sick Days: What Meds are OK
					Pain and fever reducers
					Examples: Tylenol, Aspirin
					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Use cautiously if you have renal disease.

"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Physician: Thank you for sharing your background and concerns. While your genetic profile and being Caucasian can play a role in the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), environmental factors, including exposure to secondhand smoke, may also contribute to the condition. 

Research has suggested that exposure to secondhand smoke can have detrimental effects on eye health and may increase the risk of developing AMD. The conditions you described at your workplace, particularly the poor ventilation and the presence of smokers, could have potentially exposed you to harmful substances that might have influenced your eye health over time.

It's important to consider all factors, including lifestyle and environmental exposures, when evaluating the causes of AMD. I recommend discussing this further with your eye care specialist, who can provide more personalized insights and potential management strategies for your condition.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Yes, conception is a requirement for a molar pregnancy. A molar pregnancy, also known as hydatidiform mole, occurs after the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon, resulting in the formation of a zygote. This process of fertilization is essential as it initiates the pregnancy, which can then develop into a molar pregnancy characterized by abnormal trophoblastic growth and elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Molar pregnancies can occur following a normal conception, but they are associated with specific abnormalities in the development of the placenta.","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to consider arthritis as a potential diagnosis given your symptoms of swelling, soreness, and stiffness in your hands and feet. Arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joints, which can lead to similar symptoms. However, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) can also cause issues with the peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms like pain, tingling, and weakness, which might be mistaken for arthritis.

In your case, the history of multiple surgeries on your hands and the ongoing symptoms could suggest that there might be an underlying neuropathic condition like HNPP rather than just arthritis. It's important to differentiate between the two, as the management and treatment strategies would differ significantly. I recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your symptoms in the context of the tests being done for HNPP and possibly consider further assessments to clarify the diagnosis.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."
"vasculitis. 
				Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis
				Our doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help
				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","It sounds like your wife is experiencing several concerning symptoms related to her diagnosis of giant cell vasculitis. The coffee ground vomiting indicates the presence of coagulated blood in her vomit, which can be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a serious symptom that should be evaluated by her healthcare provider immediately.

The swelling in her feet and legs, known as peripheral edema, could be related to her vasculitis or other underlying conditions. Additionally, the migraines and facial swelling may also be connected to her vasculitis, as this condition can cause inflammation of blood vessels, potentially leading to headaches and swelling.

Given the complexity of her symptoms and the potential for serious complications, it is crucial that she receives prompt medical attention. Please ensure that she contacts her healthcare provider or seeks emergency care to address these symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"To determine if you have a genetic form of Fibromyalgia, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Genetic Testing**: Consult with a genetic counselor or a specialist who can guide you through the process of genetic testing. They can help identify if there are specific genetic markers associated with Fibromyalgia or related conditions.

2. **Family History**: Discuss your family medical history with your physician. If there are other family members with Fibromyalgia or chronic pain conditions, this information may be relevant.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in chronic pain can help assess your symptoms in conjunction with your genetic background and any chromosomal abnormalities noted in your blood work.

4. **Research and Clinical Trials**: Look into ongoing research or clinical trials that focus on the genetic aspects of Fibromyalgia. Participating in such studies may provide more insights into your condition.

5. **Follow-Up Testing**: If your blood work indicated a missing chromosome, further genetic analysis may be necessary to understand the implications of that finding and its potential link to your Fibromyalgia diagnosis.

By taking these steps, you can gain a better understanding of whether there is a genetic component to your Fibromyalgia and how it may relate to your overall health.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"The decision to stop using the estradiol patch after 4.5 months should be made carefully. It's important to consider the reasons for starting the patch, the symptoms you are experiencing, and any potential side effects. If you are experiencing menopausal symptoms that the patch is helping to alleviate, it may be beneficial to continue. However, if you feel that the patch is not providing the desired benefits or if you are experiencing side effects, it may be appropriate to discuss discontinuation. 

I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment to evaluate your current situation and determine the best course of action. It's essential to ensure that any changes to your hormone replacement therapy are done under medical supervision to manage your symptoms effectively.","Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system
					applied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara system, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to

"Ear Wax.. 
				I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Using hydrogen peroxide to clean earwax can be effective, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind. 

1. **Irritation**: Hydrogen peroxide can cause irritation to the sensitive skin in the ear canal, especially if used too frequently or in high concentrations. 

2. **Ear Health**: If you have any existing ear conditions, such as otitis externa (inflammation of the outer ear) or a perforated eardrum, using hydrogen peroxide could exacerbate these issues.

3. **Impact of Bubbles**: The bubbling action of hydrogen peroxide can help to dislodge earwax, but it may also cause discomfort or a feeling of fullness in the ear.

4. **Flushing**: When you flush the ear with warm water, ensure that the water is not too hot, and be gentle to avoid damaging the ear canal.

5. **Consultation**: If you experience pain, discomfort, or if the earwax buildup persists, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional for safe removal methods, such as irrigation or syringing.

In summary, while using hydrogen peroxide occasionally may not cause harm for many people, it’s important to be cautious and aware of your ear health. If in doubt, seek advice from a healthcare provider.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most
					effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment."
"Sevoflurane. 
				I work in a hospital, and a question recently came up regarding the stability of Sevoflurane once it has been opened. Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","The stability of Sevoflurane after it has been opened can vary based on several factors, including storage conditions and exposure to air. Generally, once a medical product like Sevoflurane is opened, it may not retain its properties for the entire duration until the expiration date listed on the bottle. 

It is important to refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific information regarding the stability and effective use of Sevoflurane after opening. Typically, manufacturers provide recommendations on how long the product can be safely used after opening, which may be shorter than the expiration date. 

In summary, while Sevoflurane has an expiration date, its effectiveness after being opened may be limited, and it is advisable to follow the specific stability guidelines provided by the manufacturer.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride). In rats, this emulsion was an effective anesthetic and was not associated with adverse events. The emulsion was stable after consecutive evaluation for 365 days and for 180
					minutes after the vial was opened.. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium
					alloy."
"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a mental health condition that typically develops in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedient, negative, and agitated behavior, particularly towards authority figures. Children with ODD may frequently argue, lose their temper, and exhibit a quarrelsome attitude. Unlike Conduct Disorder, ODD does not involve aggressive behaviors, destruction of property, theft, or deceit.

ODD can co-occur with other disorders, such as Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It is classified under disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders, and can lead to significant impairment in social, academic, or other important areas of functioning.

If you have specific questions about symptoms, treatment options, or coping strategies for ODD, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical abnormalities and an increased risk of certain cancers. The primary features of BWS include:

1. **Umbilical Hernia**: This is a condition where part of the intestine protrudes through an opening in the abdominal muscles near the belly button.
2. **Macroglossia**: This refers to an enlarged tongue, which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.
3. **Gigantism**: Individuals with BWS may experience excessive growth, leading to larger-than-average body size or specific body parts.

In addition to these primary features, BWS can also present with secondary characteristics such as:

- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of internal organs.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous if not managed properly.
- **Ear Abnormalities**: These may include unusual shapes or positions of the ears.

BWS is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means it is part of a group of syndromes that can lead to excessive growth and an increased risk of malignancies. The condition is often associated with genetic imprinting disorders, where the expression of genes is affected by the parent of origin.

If you have specific questions about the diagnosis, management, or implications of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."

				Does ciprofaxin work well? Is there a better drug if so what.","Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that can be effective against various bacterial infections, including those caused by Escherichia coli. However, its effectiveness against Citrobacter freundii may vary, as this bacterium can exhibit antibiotic resistance. 

In cases where ciprofloxacin is not effective, alternative treatment options may include other antibiotics that are known to be effective against Citrobacter freundii, such as cephalosporins or aminoglycosides. It's important to perform susceptibility testing to determine the most effective antibiotic for your specific infection. 

Please consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and to discuss the best treatment options based on your condition.","There are no comparative studies of antibiotic therapy for Citrobacter infections. Thus, treatment of Citrobacter infections follows the principles for treatment of other Enterobacteriaceae infections. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities described above,
					aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and the fourth-generation cephems, such as cefepime and cefpirome, would appear to be preferred therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections.. Citrobacter species are a common cause of nosocomial infections associated with patients that are undergoing prolonged hospital treatments. C. freundii has recently been reported to express resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotincs including piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam,
					vancomycin and cephalosporins. Isolation of ceftriaxone-resistant Citrobacter freundii (CRCF) has been associated with the overprescribed broad spectrum antibiotics.. The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins."

This morning he woke up with a bit of blood drainage. Is that normal?","It's not uncommon for some drainage to occur with otitis media, especially if there is an associated infection or if the eardrum has been affected. The presence of blood drainage can be concerning, however, and it may indicate that there is a rupture of the eardrum or another complication. Since your son is already being treated with amoxicillin and antipyrine-benzocaine ear drops, it's important to monitor his symptoms closely. If the drainage continues, increases, or if he experiences worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, I recommend bringing him in for an evaluation as soon as possible. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to ear issues.","With a severe ear infection, pressure may build up and cause the eardrum to rupture. Pus and blood may drain out. This usually relieves pain and pressure, and in most cases the eardrum heals on its own.. Middle ear infections may cause pain, hearing loss, and spontaneous rupture of the eardrum, resulting in a perforation. In this case,there may be infected or bloody drainage from the ear.

reaction to these 2 drugs. I would like to know if there are any drug reaction between Carvedilol 25 mg to Hydrslazine50 mg,"Physician: There is a potential for drug interactions between Carvedilol and Hydralazine, as both are antihypertensive agents. Carvedilol is a non-cardioselective beta blocker and vasodilator, while Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator. When used together, they may enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects, which could lead to hypotension (low blood pressure). It's important to monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust dosages as necessary. Additionally, be aware of any adverse effects such as dizziness or lightheadedness.

Dicyclomine is a muscarinic antagonist primarily used for gastrointestinal spasms, while Phentermine is a central nervous system stimulant often used for weight management.

While there is no direct documented interaction between Dicyclomine and Phentermine, both medications can have side effects that may overlap or exacerbate each other. For instance, Dicyclomine can cause dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation, while Phentermine may lead to increased heart rate, anxiety, and insomnia. 

Additionally, Phentermine is contraindicated in patients with a history of drug abuse, and caution should be exercised when combining medications that have anticholinergic properties, like Dicyclomine, especially in older adults or those with certain medical conditions.

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have a genetic component, meaning that certain types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, may run in families due to hereditary factors. However, not everyone with a family history of dementia will develop the condition, and it can also occur in individuals without any known genetic predisposition. Various risk factors, including lifestyle and environmental influences, can also contribute to the development of dementia. Therefore, while genetics can play a role, it is not the sole determinant, and anyone can potentially develop dementia regardless of their family history.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease

Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options available for treating sleep apnea, particularly obstructive sleep apnea. One common procedure is called palatopharyngoplasty, which involves removing excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway. This can help reduce or eliminate the obstructions that cause apneas during sleep.

Given your husband's history and challenges with the CPAP machine, it would be beneficial for him to consult with a specialist in sleep medicine or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor who can evaluate his specific situation and discuss potential surgical options. They can provide guidance on whether surgery is appropriate based on his medical history and current health status.","Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP.

Diahrrea . I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea. Then I stop it for about 2 days so I can have a bowel movement. But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge when managing chronic diarrhea with loperamide. While loperamide is effective in reducing diarrhea, it can sometimes lead to overly soft stools or difficulty with bowel movements if used continuously. 

To find a happy medium, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adjust Dosage**: You might need to adjust the dosage of loperamide. Instead of taking it continuously, you could try a lower dose or take it only when necessary, allowing for more regular bowel movements without excessive softness.

2. **Dietary Changes**: Incorporate foods that can help firm up your stool, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet). Avoid high-fiber foods and dairy products, which can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea.

3. **Hydration**: Ensure you are staying hydrated, especially if you are experiencing diarrhea. Electrolyte solutions can help maintain your hydration levels.

4. **Consult Your Physician**: It's important to discuss your symptoms and any changes in your bowel habits with your physician. They may recommend alternative treatments or additional medications to help manage your symptoms more effectively.

5. **Monitor Stool Consistency**: Keep track of your stool consistency and any triggers that may worsen your symptoms. This information can be helpful for your physician in adjusting your treatment plan.

Finding the right balance may take some time, so be patient and work closely with your healthcare provider to tailor a plan that works for you.","IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule
					Chronic Diarrhea
					Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may
					then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
					The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further
					administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered."

While there isn't a specific ""weaning process"" for amlodipine like there is for some medications, it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely during this transition. 

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that helps lower blood pressure, while atenolol is a beta-blocker that also manages hypertension but works differently. Since you are experiencing a high pause rate, we need to ensure that switching to atenolol is safe for you. 

I recommend that you gradually reduce the amlodipine dosage under my supervision while starting atenolol at the prescribed dose of 50 mg. This way, we can monitor your response and adjust as necessary. Please keep track of any symptoms you experience and report them to me.

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"Dear Patient,

Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. Based on the information you've provided, it is understandable to feel worried after such an incident. 

Exposure to blood can potentially pose a risk for HIV transmission, especially if the blood comes from an individual who is HIV positive. However, the risk of transmission through blood exposure depends on several factors, including:

1. **The HIV status of the other person**: If the other individual is HIV positive, the risk is higher.
2. **The nature of the exposure**: Direct contact with open wounds or mucous membranes (like the eyes) increases the risk.
3. **The time elapsed before washing**: While washing the area after exposure is important, the effectiveness can vary based on how quickly it is done.

Since you mentioned that you washed the blood off your hands and face after about 15 minutes, it is good that you took action, but it is still advisable to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation. They may recommend testing for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens, especially if you are feeling anxious about the situation.

In the meantime, try to avoid any further exposure to blood and practice good hygiene. If you have any symptoms or further concerns, please seek medical attention promptly.

Take care, and I hope this helps alleviate some of your worries.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."
Swan NDC 0869-0871-43. I found 4 cases of expired (04/2010) Hydrogen Peroxide. How do I safely dispose of this product?,"To safely dispose of expired hydrogen peroxide, you should follow these steps:

1. **Check Local Regulations**: Before disposal, check your local regulations regarding hazardous waste disposal, as hydrogen peroxide can be considered hazardous in certain concentrations.

2. **Dilution**: If the hydrogen peroxide is in a low concentration (typically 3% or less), you can dilute it with water. This can help reduce its potency.

3. **Disposal in Household Waste**: After dilution, you can pour the solution down the sink or toilet, followed by running water to help it dilute further. This is generally acceptable for small amounts.

4. **Hazardous Waste Facility**: For larger quantities or higher concentrations, take the hydrogen peroxide to a local hazardous waste disposal facility. They have the proper means to handle and dispose of hazardous materials safely.

5. **Do Not Mix**: Avoid mixing hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals or substances, as this can create dangerous reactions.

6. **Labeling**: If you are transporting the product to a disposal facility, ensure it is clearly labeled as hazardous waste.

Always prioritize safety and environmental considerations when disposing of chemicals. If in doubt, consult with your local waste management authority for guidance.",Hydrogen peroxide solutions can be disposed of with no special treatment. You can safely pour them down the drain of a sink or into a toilet.
congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is primarily caused by embryologic defects in the diaphragm, which can lead to the protrusion of abdominal structures into the thorax. The exact causes of CDH are not fully understood, but it can be associated with genetic factors, environmental influences, and other congenital abnormalities. 

Cousin marriage can increase the risk of congenital disorders, including CDH, due to the potential for inherited genetic factors. If there are hereditary conditions in the family, this could contribute to the likelihood of the baby being affected.

As for lung diseases, babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia often experience pulmonary hypoplasia, which is an underdevelopment of the lung tissue. This can lead to long-term respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and other complications related to lung function. The severity of these conditions can vary based on the extent of the hernia and associated factors. Early intervention and management are crucial for improving outcomes.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","When it comes to handling food in a workplace setting, it's important to consider the implications of someone having shingles (herpes zoster). Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. While shingles itself is not directly transmitted through food, the virus can be spread through direct contact with the fluid from the blisters that appear on the skin.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Transmission Risk**: If a person with shingles has open blisters, there is a risk of transmitting the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox or has not been vaccinated against it. This is particularly important in a food handling environment where hygiene is critical.

2. **Workplace Policies**: Many workplaces have policies regarding employees who are ill, especially in food handling roles. It may be advisable for the person with shingles to avoid direct contact with food and food preparation areas until their blisters have crusted over and they are no longer contagious.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: Good hygiene practices should be maintained, including frequent hand washing and wearing gloves if necessary. Employees should also be encouraged to report any symptoms of shingles to management.

4. **Vaccination**: Consideration should be given to vaccination against shingles for employees, especially those who are at higher risk or who work in environments where they may come into contact with vulnerable populations.

5. **Consulting Health Guidelines**: It may be beneficial to consult local health guidelines or a healthcare professional for specific recommendations regarding workplace safety and food handling in the context of shingles.

In summary, while shingles does not pose a direct risk through food, precautions should be taken to prevent any potential transmission through contact with blisters.","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information

				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","Physician: Thank you for your question and for sharing your concerns. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is indeed a significant autoimmune disorder that can lead to serious complications, including thrombosis and pregnancy-related issues. The relative lack of attention to APS in research may be due to several factors, including its association primarily with female patients, as you mentioned, and the complexity of autoimmune diseases in general. 

Research funding often prioritizes conditions that have a higher mortality rate or that affect a larger population, which can sometimes lead to less focus on diseases like APS. However, this does not diminish the impact APS has on those who suffer from it, regardless of gender. 

There is ongoing research into APS, and clinical trials are essential for understanding the condition better and developing effective treatments. I encourage you to look into clinical trials that may be available for APS, as they can provide access to new therapies and contribute to the overall understanding of the syndrome. Your voice and experiences are important in advocating for more research and awareness in this area.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is recommended to be taken in the evening because cholesterol synthesis in the liver is typically higher at night. By taking simvastatin in the evening, you can maximize its effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis. 

While taking simvastatin in the morning may not cause immediate harm, it may not provide the optimal cholesterol-lowering effect compared to evening dosing. Therefore, for the best results in managing conditions like hypercholesterolemia, it is advisable to follow the recommended evening dosing schedule.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."

				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","Physician: It's important to understand that prednisone is a corticosteroid, and when someone has been on it for an extended period, like your husband, they may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking it. The symptoms you're describing—chills, fever, and abdominal pain—can be associated with steroid withdrawal syndrome. 

Prednisone can take some time to fully clear from the system, but the duration can vary based on individual metabolism and the length of time the drug was taken. Generally, prednisone has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours, but its effects can linger longer, especially after long-term use. 

As for what to expect, withdrawal symptoms can include fatigue, weakness, body aches, and mood changes, among others. It's crucial to monitor his symptoms closely. If they persist or worsen, or if he experiences severe symptoms, it's advisable to contact his healthcare provider. They may recommend a gradual tapering of the dose rather than stopping abruptly to minimize withdrawal effects. 

Make sure he stays hydrated and rests, and consider discussing any ongoing symptoms with his doctor to ensure he receives appropriate care.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics
			. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',
				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great to hear that you're looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, especially considering your history of being active. However, managing asthma while exercising can be challenging, and it's important to choose activities that minimize the risk of triggering symptoms like dyspnea (difficulty breathing).

Here are some exercise recommendations for individuals with asthma, particularly those who are overweight:

1. **Start Slow**: Begin with low-intensity activities to gauge how your body responds. Walking at a comfortable pace can be a good starting point.

2. **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always include a proper warm-up and cool-down period to help your body adjust to the changes in activity level.

3. **Choose the Right Environment**: Avoid exercising in cold, dry air or during high pollen counts, as these can exacerbate asthma symptoms. Opt for indoor activities when necessary.

4. **Low-Impact Aerobic Exercises**: Consider activities like swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical machine. These exercises are generally easier on the lungs and joints.

5. **Controlled Breathing Techniques**: Incorporate breathing exercises or techniques, such as pursed-lip breathing, to help manage breathlessness.

6. **Strength Training**: Light weight training can be beneficial. Focus on bodyweight exercises or resistance bands to start, as they can help build strength without overly taxing your respiratory system.

7. **Yoga and Stretching**: These can improve flexibility and help with relaxation, which may reduce stress-related asthma triggers.

8. **Monitor Your Symptoms**: Keep track of how you feel during and after exercise. If you experience significant difficulty breathing, it may be necessary to adjust the intensity or type of exercise.

9. **Consult with a Healthcare Provider**: Before starting any new exercise program, especially with asthma, it's wise to consult with your physician or a respiratory therapist. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific condition and needs.

Remember, the goal is to find activities that you enjoy and can do safely while managing your asthma. With the right approach, you can improve your fitness and overall health.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey. Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

					The trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...
					One recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...

I want to no how long before I go to bed am I supposed to take it.,"Physician: It's generally recommended to take Ambien (zolpidem) about 30 minutes before you plan to go to bed. This allows the medication to start working so you can fall asleep more easily. However, it's important to follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage and timing. If you have any concerns or questions about your medication, feel free to ask!","If you are taking the tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets (Edluar), or oral spray, you will take the medication as needed, not more than one time a day, immediately before bedtime. You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take zolpidem and will remain sleepy
					for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take zolpidem tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets (Edluar), and oral spray and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours.. Administration Instructions
					Patients should be counseled to take AMBIEN right before they get into bed and only when they are able to stay in bed a full night (7-8 hours) before being active again. AMBIEN tablets should not be taken with or immediately after a meal. Advise patients NOT to take AMBIEN if they drank alcohol that

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle-Branch Block is a form of heart block where the electrical stimulation of the heart ventricles is interrupted at one of the branches of the Bundle of His. This interruption prevents the simultaneous depolarization of the two ventricles, which can affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

Symptoms of Bundle-Branch Block can vary, but some common signs may include:

- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath, especially during exertion
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain or discomfort

In terms of management, treatment for Bundle-Branch Block often depends on the underlying cause and the presence of any symptoms. If the block is asymptomatic and not associated with other heart conditions, it may not require any specific treatment. However, if symptoms are present or if there are other heart issues, the physician may recommend:

- Regular monitoring through an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess heart function.
- Medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.
- In some cases, a pacemaker may be necessary to help regulate the heart's electrical signals.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized assessment and treatment plan.","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)"
general health. I have an infection in gums...dentist prescribed Cephalexin 500mg...Is this ok to take even though I am ALLERGIC TO PENICILLAN?,"Yes, it is generally considered safe for you to take Cephalexin even if you have a penicillin allergy. Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which is structurally different from penicillin. However, there is a small risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, so it's important to monitor for any allergic reactions. If you have any concerns or experience any unusual symptoms after taking the medication, please contact your healthcare provider immediately.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Physician: Yes, arrhythmias can occur after an ablation procedure, although the goal of the procedure is to eliminate or reduce them. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but many studies report success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for certain types of arrhythmias.

Regarding your Holter monitor test results, a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21 is quite significant and indicates a serious issue. A heart rate of 254 is considered tachycardia, while 21 is bradycardia, both of which can be concerning. It's important to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider, as they may indicate the need for further evaluation and management.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil as its active ingredient, similar to Viagra. Both medications work by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which leads to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the body. This results in vasodilation and improved blood flow to the penis, helping to achieve and maintain an erection.

However, it's important to note that while Fildena contains the same active ingredient as Viagra, it may not have undergone the same rigorous testing and regulatory approval process by the FDA. As you mentioned, Fildena is not FDA approved, which means it may not have the same assurances of safety, efficacy, and quality that FDA-approved medications like Viagra have.

If you're considering switching to Fildena or any other alternative, it's crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on the safety and effectiveness of the alternative, as well as monitor for any potential side effects or interactions with other medications you may be taking. Additionally, they may be able to suggest other FDA-approved options that could be covered by your insurance.","Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications
					Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you
					to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.. Fildena contains Sildenafil Citrate, a common ingredient used in various leading branded ED pills like kamagra etc. and which are available over the counter. Sildenafil Citrate was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharma. Sildenafil
					Citrate helps treat erectile dysfunction (trouble having an erection). Helps a man have an erection or have a better erection with his penis during sex. It also treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in both men and women.

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While naltrexone is primarily known as an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorder, some studies suggest it may have potential benefits in treating various mood disorders, including depression. 

However, it is essential to consult clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose naltrexone specifically for severe depression. You can search for relevant clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov to find studies that are currently investigating this treatment option. These trials will provide information on eligibility, treatment protocols, and outcomes related to the use of low-dose naltrexone in patients with severe depression.","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be transmitted through various means, depending on the type of hepatitis virus involved. The most common modes of transmission include:

1. **Bloodborne Transmission**: Hepatitis B and C are often spread through contact with infected blood. This can occur through sharing needles, transfusions of contaminated blood, or other exposure to blood.

2. **Sexual Transmission**: Hepatitis B can also be transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person.

3. **Vertical Transmission**: This refers to the transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth.

4. **Contaminated Food and Water**: Hepatitis A is typically spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water.

5. **Close Personal Contact**: Hepatitis A can also spread through close personal contact with an infected person, such as through sharing utensils or personal items.

It's important to practice good hygiene, avoid sharing needles, and ensure safe sexual practices to reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis.","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other
					injection drug equipment
					* Needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries

					HEPATITIS C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
					Routes of Transmission

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or tinea cruris, is a fungal infection that typically causes itching, redness, and a rash in the groin area. While small lumps under the skin around the scrotum can occur, they are not a common symptom of jock itch. These lumps could be related to other conditions, such as cysts or other skin issues. It's important to monitor any changes in the area, especially if the lumps are painful, growing, or accompanied by other symptoms like redness or discharge. I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination to determine the cause of the lumps and to discuss appropriate treatment options for your jock itch.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

general health. What are the causes of rib cage pain? And and the remedy,"Rib cage pain can be caused by several conditions, including:

1. **Tietze's Syndrome**: This is characterized by painful swellings of the costal cartilages, particularly the second rib, and can mimic the pain associated with coronary artery disease.

2. **Pleurisy**: This is the inflammation of the pleura, the lining of the lungs, which can lead to pleuritic chest pain, especially when the parietal pleura is involved.

3. **Muscle Strain**: Overexertion or injury to the muscles around the rib cage can lead to muscle strains, resulting in pain.

4. **Rib Fractures**: Fractures of the ribs can occur due to trauma or injury, leading to significant pain in the rib cage area.

**Remedies** for rib cage pain depend on the underlying cause but may include:

- **Rest**: Allowing the body to heal, especially in cases of muscle strain or rib fractures.
- **Ice or Heat Therapy**: Applying ice packs to reduce inflammation or heat packs to relax muscles can be beneficial.
- **Pain Relief Medications**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain.
- **Physical Therapy**: For muscle strains or post-injury rehabilitation, physical therapy may be recommended.
- **Medical Treatment**: For conditions like Tietze's syndrome or pleurisy, consulting a healthcare provider for specific treatments is essential.

If the pain is severe or persistent, it is important to seek medical attention to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.","Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
					Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
					Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis)
					Osteoporosis
					Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
					Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.

					Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain."

Specifically, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is an acute respiratory illness caused by the Sin Nombre virus, which can result in rapid respiratory failure. Additionally, other diseases caused by hantaviruses, such as Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome, can also be serious and potentially fatal. It's important to seek medical attention if you suspect exposure to hantavirus or experience symptoms associated with these diseases.","Hantavirus is a serious infection that gets worse quickly. Lung failure can occur and may lead to death. Even with aggressive treatment, more than one half of people who have this disease in their lungs die."
general health. Is there always elevated temperature associated with appendicitis?,"While elevated temperature, or fever, is commonly associated with appendicitis due to the inflammatory process involved, it is not always present. Some patients may experience appendicitis without a significant fever. The presence and degree of fever can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the appendicitis, which can be classified as simple, gangrenous, or perforated. Therefore, while fever can be a symptom, it is not a definitive indicator of appendicitis in every case.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main
					symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include
					Swelling in the abdomen
					Loss of appetite
					Nausea and vomiting
					Constipation or diarrhea
					Inability to pass gas

"Frequency	. My urologist has prescribed Oxybutinin, 5 mg tablets, NOT in the ER version. I understood they were to be taken once a day, but he has prescribed twice. Is this the correct recommended dosage, or should the prescription have been for once a day?","The recommended dosage of Oxybutynin can vary based on individual patient needs and the specific formulation prescribed. While the extended-release (ER) version is typically taken once a day, the immediate-release form, like the 5 mg tablets your urologist prescribed, is often taken multiple times a day. If your urologist has prescribed the 5 mg tablets to be taken twice a day, that is likely the appropriate dosage for your situation. However, it's always best to confirm with your urologist or pharmacist if you have any concerns or questions about your medication regimen.","Adults
					The usual dose is one 5-mg tablet two to three times a day. The maximum recommended dose is one 5-mg tablet four times a day. A lower starting dose of 2.5 mg two or three times a day is recommended for the frail elderly."

Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to note the following:

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: There is a potential interaction between diclofenac (an NSAID) and lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor). NSAIDs can reduce the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and may lead to kidney issues, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when using these medications together.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and naproxen are NSAIDs. Taking them together can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, as well as kidney damage. It is generally not recommended to use two NSAIDs concurrently.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: There is no direct interaction between diclofenac and acetaminophen. They can be used together, but it is important to monitor the total dosage of acetaminophen to avoid liver damage, especially if the patient has liver issues.

In summary, it is advisable to avoid taking diclofenac with lisinopril and naproxen. If considering the combination of diclofenac and acetaminophen, ensure that the acetaminophen dosage remains within safe limits. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, also known as trisomy 13, is a genetic disorder that can lead to a variety of severe abnormalities. The progression of the condition can vary significantly among individuals. Generally, the prognosis for those with Patau syndrome is poor, and many affected individuals do not survive past infancy. For those who do survive, they may experience worsening symptoms over time, particularly related to developmental delays and physical abnormalities.

To diagnose Patau syndrome, healthcare providers typically use a combination of physical examinations and genetic testing. A diagnosis can often be made through prenatal screening methods, such as ultrasound or non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which can indicate the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. After birth, a karyotype analysis can confirm the diagnosis by identifying the extra chromosome 13.

If you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask!","Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed
					eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within

"quinine in seltzer water.. quinine in seltzer water.
				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct ""dosage""? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.","Yes, drinking quinine in seltzer water can be an option to help ease leg cramps, as quinine is known to potentially treat and prevent muscle cramps. However, it's important to consider the appropriate dosage. 

Quinine is available in various dosages, such as 1 MG, 5 MG, 50 MG, and up to 500 MG. The specific dosage that would be appropriate for you can depend on several factors, including your overall health, any other medications you may be taking, and the severity of your leg cramps. 

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the correct dosage for your situation, as they can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and needs. Additionally, be aware of any potential adverse effects associated with quinine, and ensure that it is safe for you to use.","Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

					The evidence is current to October 2014."
"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For the treatment and prevention of mite infestation in humans, particularly focusing on non-toxic options or those with minimal side effects, here are some recommendations:

### Treatment:
1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: A common treatment for scabies, it is applied to the skin and is generally well-tolerated.
   - **Ivermectin**: An oral medication that can be used for severe cases or when topical treatments are ineffective. It is usually well-tolerated but should be used under medical supervision.

2. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Tea Tree Oil**: Known for its antimicrobial properties, it may help in reducing mite populations on the skin. Dilute it with a carrier oil before application.
   - **Neem Oil**: Another natural option that has been used for its insecticidal properties.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: 
   - Regular bathing and washing of clothes and bedding in hot water can help eliminate mites and their eggs.

### Prevention:
1. **Environmental Control**: 
   - Keep living areas clean and free of dust and debris where mites can thrive. Regular vacuuming and dusting are essential.
   - Use protective covers on mattresses and pillows to prevent mite infestations.

2. **Avoiding Contact**: 
   - Limit close contact with individuals known to have mite infestations, such as those with scabies.

3. **Regular Skin Care**: 
   - Maintain healthy skin through moisturization and avoiding irritants that can compromise the skin barrier, making it more susceptible to infestations.

### Monitoring for Side Effects:
- While the treatments mentioned are generally safe, it is important to monitor for any adverse effects, such as skin irritation or allergic reactions, especially with topical applications. If any severe reactions occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.

By following these treatment and prevention strategies, you can effectively manage mite infestations while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Maternal Diabetes**: If the mother has gestational diabetes, the newborn may experience hypoglycemia after birth due to high insulin levels.
2. **Prematurity**: Premature infants may have immature metabolic systems, making them more susceptible to low blood sugar.
3. **Low Birth Weight**: Infants with low birth weight may not have enough glycogen stores to maintain normal blood glucose levels.
4. **Inadequate Feeding**: Delayed or insufficient feeding after birth can lead to hypoglycemia.
5. **Infections or Illness**: Newborns with infections or other health issues may have disrupted glucose metabolism.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Manage Blood Sugar Levels**: If diagnosed with gestational diabetes, closely monitor and manage blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, and medication as prescribed by a healthcare provider.
2. **Regular Prenatal Care**: Attend all prenatal appointments to monitor the health of both mother and baby.
3. **Healthy Diet**: Maintain a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support fetal growth and development.
4. **Educate on Feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed promptly and adequately, whether through breastfeeding or formula.
5. **Monitor for Symptoms**: Be aware of signs of hypoglycemia in the newborn, such as lethargy, poor feeding, or unusual irritability, and seek medical attention if these occur.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, a CT scan (X-Ray Computed Tomography) can be used to detect both diverticulosis and diverticulitis, even in the absence of an infection. Diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of multiple diverticuli in the walls of the intestine, which can be visualized on a CT scan. Diverticulitis, which involves inflammation of these diverticula, can also be identified through imaging, as it may show signs of inflammation or complications associated with the diverticula. Therefore, a CT scan is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing these conditions regardless of the presence of infection.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by colds while others are not can be attributed to several factors, including their immune response. When a cold virus, which is a type of pathogenic organism, enters the body, the immune system activates to fight off the infection. This immune response can vary significantly from person to person based on factors such as genetics, overall health, and previous exposure to similar viruses.

Individuals with a strong immune response may be able to fend off the virus more effectively, preventing them from developing symptoms. Additionally, some people may have built up immunity through past infections or vaccinations, providing them with cross protection against the cold virus. On the other hand, those with a weaker immune response may be more susceptible to the contagion and may experience more severe symptoms.

In summary, while contagion plays a role in the transmission of cold germs, the immune response is crucial in determining who gets affected and who remains unaffected.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg- 1 daily. Doctor prescribed for type 2 diabetes w/Metformin 500 mg 2 times daily. Pharmacy refused to fill stating overdose of Metformin. Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"The pharmacy's concern about a potential overdose of Metformin may be valid, depending on the total daily dosage being prescribed. 

In your case, you are taking Janumet XR, which contains 1000 mg of Metformin and 50 mg of Sitagliptin, once daily. Additionally, you are prescribed Metformin 500 mg two times daily, which adds up to another 1000 mg of Metformin. This results in a total daily dosage of 2000 mg of Metformin (1000 mg from Janumet XR + 1000 mg from the additional Metformin).

The maximum recommended daily dosage of Metformin for adults is typically 2000 mg to 2500 mg, depending on the specific formulation and individual patient factors. Therefore, if you are taking 2000 mg total, you are at the upper limit of the recommended dosage.

It is essential to discuss this with your physician to clarify the prescription and ensure that it is safe and appropriate for your condition. If the physician confirms that this dosage is suitable for you, you may need to provide that information to the pharmacy to resolve the issue.",The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets are 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).
SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) typically occurs in children and young adults, usually 2-8 years after an initial measles infection. While it is rare, the condition is primarily associated with individuals who had measles during childhood. Since your son is 33 years old and did not receive the measles vaccination, he may not have had measles as a child, which significantly reduces the likelihood of developing SSPE. However, if he were to contract measles now, there is a potential risk for SSPE to develop in the future, typically several years after the measles infection. It is important to discuss vaccination options with a healthcare provider to prevent measles and its complications.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about your granddaughter's condition. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare vascular malformation that can affect the limbs, and it often requires a multidisciplinary approach for management. 

Currently, treatment options may include:

1. **Symptom Management**: This involves addressing any symptoms she may be experiencing, such as pain or swelling in the affected leg. Supportive care can help improve her quality of life.

2. **Physical Therapy**: Engaging in physical therapy can help improve mobility and strength in her leg.

3. **Surgical Options**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to address significant vascular malformations or to improve function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: It's important to have regular check-ups with a specialist who understands Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome to monitor her condition and adjust treatment as needed.

For current research, I recommend checking clinical trial registries like ClinicalTrials.gov for studies related to Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. This can provide insights into new treatments and therapies that are being explored. Additionally, connecting with support groups or organizations focused on vascular malformations may provide valuable resources and information.

If you have any specific symptoms or concerns, please let me know, and I can provide more tailored advice.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."

Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"In the case of inherited ricketts, if the mother has an autosomal dominant disorder, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Since you mentioned that the mother is passing it to child A but not to child B, it indicates that child B did not inherit the mutant allele from the mother. Therefore, child B would not pass it on to their own children, as they do not carry the allele associated with the disorder. In summary, child B has a 0% chance of passing on inherited ricketts to their child.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."
"Medicare Part B coverage. I suffer with acute fibromyalgia (sp?) and the various drugs my doctor has prescribed for me have little if any effect in helping to control the pain. My doctor has since given me a prescription to have massage therapy which she thought medicare would cover. However, when checking with

1. **Physical Therapy**: Engaging in a structured physical therapy program can help improve mobility and reduce pain through targeted exercises and techniques.

2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This form of therapy can help you manage the psychological aspects of fibromyalgia, such as stress and depression, which may contribute to your pain.

3. **Pain Management Programs**: These programs often take an interdisciplinary approach, combining various methods such as medication, physical therapy, and psychological support to help manage pain more effectively.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: Consider exploring complementary therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, or tai chi, which some patients find beneficial for managing fibromyalgia symptoms.

5. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Incorporating regular low-impact exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and practicing good sleep hygiene can also help alleviate symptoms.

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR gene, particularly the A1298C variant, can have implications for health, especially in relation to folate metabolism and associated conditions. Being homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant (meaning you have two copies of the A1298C allele) may affect your body's ability to process folate effectively, which can lead to elevated homocysteine levels. Elevated homocysteine is associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and complications during pregnancy.

In terms of long-term prognosis, individuals who are homozygous for the A1298C variant may be at a higher risk for certain health conditions, but the actual impact can vary widely among individuals. Factors such as diet, lifestyle, and other genetic factors also play significant roles in health outcomes. 

It's important to monitor your health and discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider, who may recommend lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, or supplementation with folate or other B vitamins to help mitigate potential risks associated with this genetic variant. Regular check-ups and personalized health strategies can contribute to a better long-term prognosis.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can lead to various side effects, although flatulence is not commonly reported as a direct effect of Vitamin D supplementation. However, some individuals may experience gastrointestinal discomfort, which could include flatulence, especially if they are not accustomed to such high doses.

Regarding safety, while high doses of Vitamin D can be effective in raising very low levels of the vitamin in the body, it is essential to monitor for potential toxicity. The upper limit for Vitamin D intake is generally considered to be 4,000 IUs per day for most adults, and doses above this should be taken under medical supervision. It is advisable to have your Vitamin D levels monitored regularly and to consult with your healthcare provider to ensure that the dosage is appropriate for your specific needs and to avoid any adverse effects.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To prevent a shingles outbreak, it is important to consider vaccination as a primary method. The shingles vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of developing herpes zoster (shingles) and its associated complications. Additionally, maintaining a healthy immune system through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing stress can help lower the risk of activation of the varicella-zoster virus, which causes shingles. If you have had chickenpox in the past, it's especially important to discuss vaccination options with your healthcare provider, as those who have had chickenpox are at risk for shingles later in life.","How Can You Reduce Your Risk of Getting Shingles?
					Vaccination is the only way to reduce your risk of shingles and PHN. CDC recommends adults age 60 years or older receive a single dose of shingles vaccine.

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and cysts, especially in the context of your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While CVID itself is primarily an immunodeficiency disorder, it can complicate the management of other health issues, including thyroid conditions.

Regarding your thyroid tumor, tumors greater than 1 cm are typically monitored closely, as they can have varying implications depending on their characteristics. The presence of thyroid cysts is also common, and while many are benign, they can sometimes be associated with neoplasms.

Current statistics indicate that the risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules increases with size, and tumors greater than 1 cm may warrant further evaluation, including imaging or biopsy, depending on their features. Your endocrinologist will be the best resource for monitoring your condition and determining the appropriate next steps.

It's also worth noting that individuals with immunodeficiencies like CVID may have different responses to treatments and monitoring protocols, so maintaining open communication with your healthcare team is crucial. If you have specific concerns about cancer risk or the implications of your CVID on your thyroid health, don't hesitate to discuss them with your endocrinologist.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.

diabete. whats diabete,"Diabetes Mellitus is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia, which is an abnormally high blood glucose level, and glucose intolerance. There are different types of diabetes, including Type 1 (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) and Type 2 (Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus). Type 1 is characterized by insulin deficiency and often occurs in childhood or adolescence, while Type 2 is associated with insulin resistance and is more common in adults, though it can occur at any age. Managing diabetes typically involves monitoring blood sugar levels and may require medications such as insulin for Type 1 diabetes.","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."
wellbutrin xl 150. how to taper off,"When tapering off Wellbutrin XL (bupropion), it's important to do so gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms and potential adverse effects. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Consult Your Physician**: Before making any changes to your medication regimen, discuss your plans with your healthcare provider. They can provide a personalized tapering schedule based on your specific situation.

2. **Gradual Reduction**: A common method is to reduce the dosage by 10-25% every few weeks. For example, if you are taking 150 mg, you might reduce to 100 mg for a few weeks before stopping completely.

3. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep track of any withdrawal symptoms or changes in mood. If you experience significant discomfort, consult your physician, as they may recommend adjusting the tapering schedule.

4. **Supportive Care**: Engage in supportive therapies, such as counseling or support groups, to help manage any emotional or psychological challenges during the tapering process.

5. **Follow-Up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments with your physician to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your tapering plan.

Remember, the goal is to taper off safely and comfortably, so open communication with your healthcare provider is key.","1. he tapered off bupropion SR, taking 150 mg/day for 4 days followed by 150 mg every other day for 8 days (4 total doses) and 150 mg every third day for 6 days (2 total doses) without further complications.

I wonder if, despite not being a sexual cervicitis
				infection, it can cause infertility. And that's what makes a tampon that causes inflammation. Thank you very much!","Hello! Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. Chronic cervicitis, especially when associated with inflammation, can indeed have implications for fertility. While cervicitis itself is not always directly linked to infertility, chronic inflammation of the cervix can affect the reproductive process. 

In your case, since the inflammation is not due to a bacterial infection, it may still impact the cervical mucus, which plays a crucial role in sperm transport. If the cervical environment is altered due to inflammation, it could potentially hinder fertility.

As for tampon use, while tampons are generally safe, improper use or prolonged wear can lead to irritation or inflammation of the cervix in some individuals. It's essential to ensure that tampons are used correctly and changed regularly to minimize any risk of irritation.

I recommend discussing your concerns further with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your specific situation and may suggest additional tests or treatments to address both the inflammation and any potential fertility issues.

"trisomy 7. trisomy 7. i am a 32 y/o who has had 4 miscarriages in the past 19 months. Upon my last DNC two weeks ago revealed a genetics study diagnosis of the baby having trisomy 7. could you offer me any information on this? could this have been maternal or paternal? is this something i would be
				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Physician: Thank you for sharing your situation. Trisomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality where there is an extra copy of chromosome 7 in the cells. This condition can lead to various developmental issues, and it is often associated with miscarriages, especially in early pregnancy.

Regarding your question about whether this could be maternal or paternal, trisomy 7 can arise from errors during cell division, which can occur in either the egg or sperm. However, it is more commonly associated with maternal age, as older maternal age can increase the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. 

As for being a carrier, typically, trisomy 7 is not inherited in a traditional sense. It usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development. However, in some cases, there may be a risk of a parent being a carrier of a chromosomal rearrangement that could lead to such abnormalities. Genetic counseling and further genetic studies can help clarify this.

The exact causes of trisomy 7 are not fully understood, but it is classified under chromosome aberrations, which can result from nondisjunction during meiosis (the process of cell division that produces eggs and sperm). 

I recommend discussing your concerns with a genetic counselor who can provide more personalized information and support based on your specific situation and family history. They can also help you understand the implications of your previous miscarriages and any potential next steps for future pregnancies.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."
metformin. Does metformin cause high blood pressure?,"Metformin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is not typically associated with causing high blood pressure. In fact, some studies suggest that metformin may have a neutral or even beneficial effect on blood pressure in diabetic patients. However, individual responses can vary, and it's important to monitor blood pressure regularly, especially if you have other risk factors for hypertension. If you have concerns about your blood pressure while taking metformin, please discuss them with your healthcare provider.","1.

intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine have several detrimental effects on digestion and absorption in the intestines. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which can reduce blood flow to the intestines. This decreased circulation can impair the delivery of oxygen and nutrients necessary for optimal digestive function and absorption.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can disrupt the normal motility of the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to issues such as delayed gastric emptying or altered bowel movements, which can affect the overall digestion process.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may influence the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and other glands, potentially leading to inadequate breakdown of food and reduced nutrient absorption.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease. These conditions can further complicate digestion and absorption.

5. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can negatively affect the composition of gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in digestion and absorption. An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to digestive issues and reduced nutrient uptake.

6. **Nutrient Absorption**: Smoking can impair the absorption of certain nutrients, particularly vitamins and minerals. For example, smokers may have lower levels of vitamin C and other antioxidants, which are essential for overall health.

In summary, smoking and nicotine can significantly disrupt the processes of digestion and absorption in the intestines, leading to various gastrointestinal issues and nutrient deficiencies. It is advisable for individuals to consider these effects when evaluating their smoking habits and overall health.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa."
sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Yes, swelling in the feet, ankles, and legs can occur in individuals with fibromyalgia. While fibromyalgia is primarily characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, it can also be associated with other symptoms, including swelling. This swelling may be related to inflammation or fluid retention, which can sometimes accompany fibromyalgia. It's important to monitor your symptoms and discuss any new or worsening swelling with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.","1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about potential risks after an accidental needle stick injury, especially when it involves a cancer patient. While cancer itself is not transmitted through blood contact, there are other infections that can be transmitted if the needle was contaminated. 

Since you mentioned that the needle was used for an insulin injection, the risk of transmitting cancer is not a concern. However, if the needle was contaminated with any infectious agents, there could be a risk of blood-borne infections. It's important to monitor for any signs of infection and consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and possible testing. They may recommend post-exposure prophylaxis or other measures based on the specific circumstances. Please take care and seek medical advice promptly.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities. Engaging in activities that put stress on the plantar fascia, such as running, standing for long periods, or walking on hard surfaces, can exacerbate the condition and lead to increased heel pain.

In addition to weight-bearing activities, other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper support or cushioning can worsen symptoms.
2. **Increased Activity Levels**: Sudden increases in physical activity or intensity can lead to flare-ups.
3. **Obesity**: Excess weight can put additional strain on the plantar fascia.
4. **Biomechanical Issues**: Conditions such as flat feet or high arches can contribute to the aggravation of plantar fasciitis.
5. **Inactivity**: Conversely, prolonged periods of inactivity followed by sudden activity can also lead to aggravation.

It's important to manage these factors to help alleviate symptoms and prevent further aggravation of plantar fasciitis. If you have any specific concerns or symptoms, please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can potentially be detected during an examination of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly through imaging techniques or diagnostic procedures. 

Imaging techniques can visualize abnormalities in the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. If there are enlarged lymph nodes or signs of liver cancer, these may be identified during such imaging studies. Additionally, if a diagnostic procedure like an endoscopy is performed, it may allow for direct visualization and assessment of any abnormalities related to lymph nodes or the liver.

However, it's important to note that while the upper GI tract examination can provide valuable information, specific tests targeting the lymphatic system or liver may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					anemia
					gastroesophageal reflux disease
					ulcers
					cancer
					inflammation, or swelling
					precancerous abnormalities

					2. Tests for Liver Cancer

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"An abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious complications, including the risk of heart problems. When an abscess occurs, it indicates an infection that can spread to other parts of the body, including the bloodstream, a condition known as bacteremia. If bacteria from the abscess enter the bloodstream, they can travel to the heart and potentially cause endocarditis, which is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. 

While an abscessed tooth itself does not directly cause a heart attack, the infections and complications associated with it can increase the risk of cardiovascular issues, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. It is important to seek prompt treatment for dental abscesses to prevent such complications.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Ischemic syncope refers to a temporary loss of consciousness due to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, often resulting from a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), commonly known as a stroke. In this context, ""ischemic"" indicates that the loss of blood supply is due to obstruction of blood vessels, which can be caused by thrombosis (a blood clot forming in a blood vessel) or embolism (a clot that travels from another part of the body). 

A stroke is characterized by sudden neurological deficits due to brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage, leading to tissue necrosis. In the case of ischemic syncope, the symptoms are typically brief and reversible, lasting less than 24 hours, and often less than one hour. It is crucial to differentiate between a transient ischemic attack and a full-blown stroke, as the latter may result in permanent neurological deficits. 

If you have further questions or need clarification on specific aspects, feel free to ask!","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Rheumatologists specialize in treating rheumatic diseases, which often include autoimmune disorders. They are trained to perform various diagnostic tests, such as autoantibody tests, to help diagnose and manage these conditions.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any

"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is known to potentially cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect. This occurs because Effexor is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which can affect neurotransmitter levels and lead to sexual side effects, including ED. 

The exact minimum amount of Effexor that may not cause ED can vary significantly from person to person, as individual responses to medication can differ based on factors such as dosage, duration of treatment, and personal health conditions. Some patients may experience ED at lower doses, while others may not experience it even at higher doses. 

If you are concerned about the side effects you are experiencing, including ED, it is important to discuss this with your physician. They can help determine the best course of action, which may include adjusting your dosage or considering alternative treatments.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have been associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in some cases, although the exact duration of this association is not well-defined. The potential for NSAIDs to contribute to ED may stem from their effects on blood flow and prostaglandin synthesis, which can influence erectile function. While some studies suggest a link, the evidence is not universally conclusive, and individual responses to NSAIDs can vary. If you have concerns about the use of NSAIDs and their potential impact on erectile function, it would be advisable to discuss this further with your healthcare provider.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by a pathological constriction at the aortic valve, which restricts the outflow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. This can lead to various complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy, where the left ventricle enlarges due to the increased pressure it must generate to pump blood through the narrowed valve. 

Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and heart murmurs, which are abnormal sounds caused by turbulent blood flow through the heart. The condition can be diagnosed through physical examination and imaging techniques, such as echocardiography.

Management of aortic stenosis often involves monitoring the condition, and in severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to replace or repair the aortic valve. It's important to discuss any concerns or symptoms with your healthcare provider for appropriate evaluation and treatment options.","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"Leukocytosis, or an increase in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the body, can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:

1. **Infection**: The body often responds to infections by increasing white blood cell production to help fight off pathogens.

2. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases or injuries, can also lead to elevated white blood cell counts.

3. **Stress**: Biological adaptation to stress can trigger an increase in white blood cells as part of the body's response to stressors.

4. **Hypersensitivity Reactions**: Allergic reactions can cause an increase in certain types of white blood cells, particularly eosinophils.

5. **Other Medical Conditions**: Various diseases, including certain cancers and bone marrow disorders, can lead to leukocytosis.

If you have specific symptoms or concerns, it would be best to discuss them further with your healthcare provider.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
