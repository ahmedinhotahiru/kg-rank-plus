Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases are both hereditary conditions, but they are distinct disorders with different genetic causes and manifestations. 

1. **Noonan Syndrome**: This is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by features such as short stature, webbed neck, ptosis, skeletal malformations, and various cardiac abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in several genes, with PTPN11 being the most common. Noonan syndrome can occur in both males and females and is classified under hereditary diseases.

2. **Polycystic Kidney Diseases**: These are hereditary diseases characterized by the progressive expansion of numerous cysts within the kidneys. They can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. 

While there is no direct relation mentioned between Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney diseases in the provided content, both conditions fall under the broader category of hereditary diseases. If you are looking for specific references or studies that link these two conditions, it may be beneficial to consult medical literature or genetic databases for any documented cases of co-occurrence or shared genetic pathways.","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"As a physician, I would advise you on the following regarding a positive VDRL test result:

### Diagnosis:
A positive VDRL test indicates the presence of antibodies that may suggest a syphilis infection, but it is important to note that this test is non-specific and can yield false positives due to other conditions. Therefore, further confirmatory testing is necessary to diagnose syphilis accurately. This may include more specific tests such as the FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) test.

### Precautions:
1. **Consult a Specialist**: It is crucial to follow up with a healthcare provider or a specialist in infectious diseases for further evaluation and management.
2. **Avoid Sexual Contact**: Until a definitive diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated, it is advisable to avoid sexual contact to prevent potential transmission of syphilis to partners.
3. **Inform Partners**: Notify any recent sexual partners about the positive test result so they can also get tested and treated if necessary.
4. **Follow Treatment Guidelines**: If diagnosed with syphilis, adhere to the treatment plan prescribed by your healthcare provider, which may include antibiotics such as penicillin.

### Next Steps:
- Schedule a follow-up appointment for confirmatory testing.
- Discuss any symptoms you may be experiencing, as well as your sexual history, to provide your healthcare provider with the necessary information for a comprehensive evaluation.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The effects of anesthesia on patients with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) can vary based on individual health factors and the specifics of the procedure. Generally, anesthesia is administered to ensure that patients do not experience pain during surgery, such as a hip replacement. However, FXTAS patients may have unique neurological considerations due to their condition, which could potentially influence how they respond to anesthesia.

It is important to discuss any concerns regarding anesthesia with the surgical team, including the anesthesiologist, who can evaluate the patient's medical history and current health status. They can provide tailored recommendations and monitor the patient closely during the procedure to minimize any risks. Overall, while anesthesia is necessary for comfort during surgery, the medical team will take precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of FXTAS patients.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, Ocella, like other hormonal birth control methods, can increase the risk of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms your daughter is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, and swelling in her thigh, along with large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could be indicative of DVT or other complications. Given that these symptoms have worsened after childbirth, it is crucial for her to discuss this with her doctor as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is important to assess her condition and determine the appropriate course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","Given your history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and your allergies to penicillin and dairy products, it’s important to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective against UTIs and do not contain these allergens.

1. **Nitrofurantoin**: This is often used for uncomplicated UTIs and may be a good option for you. It is generally well-tolerated and does not contain dairy.

2. **Cefadroxil**: Although it is a cephalosporin and may have some cross-reactivity with penicillin, some patients who are allergic to penicillin can tolerate it. Discuss this option with your doctor to see if it’s appropriate for you.

3. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)**: This is another common antibiotic for UTIs, but you should confirm with your doctor that it is safe for you, especially if you have any other allergies.

4. **Fosfomycin**: This is a single-dose treatment that can be effective for uncomplicated UTIs and is generally well-tolerated.

5. **Ciprofloxacin**: While you have taken this medication multiple times, if it has been effective in the past, your doctor may consider a different dosing strategy or a longer course.

Make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider, as they can help determine the best course of action based on your specific medical history and current health status. Additionally, it may be beneficial to investigate the underlying causes of your recurrent UTIs, as this could help in preventing future infections.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Yes, a streptococcal infection can potentially lead to complications that may resemble or contribute to conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). While streptococcal infections primarily cause localized infections, they can trigger autoimmune reactions in some individuals, leading to systemic issues. For example, there is an association between streptococcal infections and certain autoimmune conditions, which may include symptoms similar to those seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, such as respiratory tract involvement and systemic inflammation. However, it is important to note that granulomatosis with polyangiitis is primarily a vasculitis with a complex genetic background, and while infections can be a trigger, they are not the direct cause of the disease. If you are experiencing symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and appropriate management.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.
					* GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.The cause of GPA is unknown. GPA often affects the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if not treated.. Wegener's granulomatosis triggered by infection?
					Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease of unknown origin, although recent studies suggest that auto-immune mechanisms and infection play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. During follow-up, nasal carriage of Staphyloccocus Aureus could be documented. An overview of Wegener's
					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or ""group A strep."" This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is
					external).

					Severe Strep Infections

					Some types of group A strep bacteria cause severe infections, such as

					Bacteremia (bloodstream infections) - To learn more visit visit the MedlinePlus sepsis site (link is external).
					Toxic shock syndrome (multi-organ infection) - To learn more visit the MedlinePlus toxic shock syndrome site (link is external).
					Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) - To learn more visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention necrotizing fasciitis site (link is external).
					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

					Fever and chills
					Cough
					Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
					Chest pain
					Skin and soft-tissue infections often appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be:

					Red
					Swollen or painful
					Warm to the touch
					Full of pus or other drainage
					These skin infections may also be accompanied by a fever.

					Bone and joint infections often appear as pain in the infected area and might also include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Swelling
					Stiffness or inability to use affected limb or joint
					Rarely in adults, group B strep bacteria can cause meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord)."
"Diabetes and pain control. 
				How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.","To narrow your search for information on pain (joint) medication suitable for a person with Type 2 diabetes, consider the following steps:

1. **Focus on Analgesics**: Look for analgesics that are known to be safe for individuals with diabetes. Some common options include acetaminophen and certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but be cautious with NSAIDs as they can affect kidney function, which is a concern for diabetic patients.

2. **Check for Drug Interactions**: Investigate potential drug interactions between analgesics and any medications the patient may already be taking for diabetes management. This can help avoid adverse effects and ensure safe pain management.

3. **Consider Pain Management Techniques**: Explore non-pharmacological pain management techniques that can complement medication, such as physical therapy, exercise, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can be beneficial for joint pain.

4. **Consult Clinical Guidelines**: Refer to clinical guidelines or recommendations from diabetes associations regarding pain management in diabetic patients. These resources often provide evidence-based information on safe medication options.

5. **Evaluate Patient's Overall Health**: Assess the patient's overall health, including any comorbidities, to tailor pain management strategies effectively.

By focusing on these areas, you can find relevant information that addresses pain management for a patient with Type 2 diabetes.","Diabetes and Sick Days: What Meds are OK
					Pain and fever reducers
					Examples: Tylenol, Aspirin
					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Use cautiously if you have renal disease.

					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Also should be used carefully if you have renal disease."
"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Physician: Thank you for sharing your background and concerns. While your genetic profile and being Caucasian can play a role in the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), environmental factors, including exposure to secondhand smoke, may also contribute to the condition. 

Research has shown that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can have various negative health effects, and it is possible that it could increase the risk of developing AMD, especially in individuals who are already predisposed due to age or genetic factors. Given that you were exposed to secondhand smoke in a work environment with poor ventilation, it is reasonable to consider this as a potential contributing factor to your early AMD diagnosis.

It's important to discuss your concerns with your eye care specialist, who can provide more personalized insights and recommendations based on your specific situation. They may also suggest monitoring your condition closely and exploring treatment options if necessary.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Yes, conception is a requirement for a molar pregnancy. A molar pregnancy, or hydatidiform mole, occurs after the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon, leading to the formation of a zygote. However, in the case of a molar pregnancy, the fertilization process results in abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue rather than a viable embryo. This abnormal growth can manifest as either a complete or partial hydatidiform mole, characterized by the swelling of the chorionic villi and elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Therefore, conception must occur for a molar pregnancy to develop, but the outcome is not a normal pregnancy.","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to consider arthritis as a potential diagnosis given your symptoms of swelling, soreness, and stiffness in your hands and feet. Arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joints, which can lead to similar symptoms. However, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) can also cause issues with the nerves, leading to pain, tingling, and weakness, which might be mistaken for arthritis symptoms.

In your case, the history of multiple surgeries on your hands and the ongoing symptoms could suggest that there might be an underlying neuropathic condition like HNPP rather than just arthritis. It's important to discuss these concerns with your healthcare provider, as they can perform the necessary tests to differentiate between the two conditions and provide a more accurate diagnosis.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."
"vasculitis. 
				Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis
				Our doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help
				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","It sounds like your wife is experiencing several concerning symptoms related to her diagnosis of giant cell vasculitis. The coffee ground vomiting you mentioned is indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur in various conditions, including vasculitis. This type of vomiting occurs due to the presence of coagulated blood, and it is important to address this symptom promptly with her healthcare team.

The swelling in her feet and legs, known as peripheral edema, can also be associated with vasculitis, particularly if there is fluid retention or issues with circulation. Additionally, migraines and facial swelling can be related to the underlying inflammatory processes associated with vasculitis.

Given the complexity of her symptoms and the potential for serious complications, I strongly recommend that you contact her healthcare provider immediately to discuss these symptoms. They may need to perform further evaluations, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to determine the cause of her vomiting and swelling and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly. It's crucial to ensure she receives appropriate care as soon as possible.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.. GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

					Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis."
can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"To determine if you have a genetic form of fibromyalgia, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Genetic Counseling**: Consult with a genetic counselor who can assess your family history and discuss the potential genetic factors related to fibromyalgia and other conditions you may have.

2. **Genetic Testing**: Ask your physician about the possibility of genetic testing. While there is currently no specific genetic test for fibromyalgia, testing may help identify any chromosomal abnormalities or genetic predispositions that could be relevant to your symptoms.

3. **Research and Clinical Trials**: Look into ongoing research studies or clinical trials that focus on the genetic aspects of fibromyalgia. Participating in such studies may provide more insight into the genetic factors associated with your condition.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Work with your healthcare team to conduct a thorough evaluation of your symptoms, medical history, and any other conditions you have. This can help in understanding the relationship between your chromosomal abnormality and fibromyalgia.

5. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest research on fibromyalgia and genetics, as this is an evolving field. New findings may provide more clarity on the genetic components of fibromyalgia in the future.

By following these steps, you can gain a better understanding of whether there is a genetic component to your fibromyalgia diagnosis.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"It's important to discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your healthcare provider. Since you've been using the estradiol patch for 4.5 months, your physician can help assess your current symptoms and determine whether discontinuing the patch is appropriate for you. They may consider factors such as the severity of your menopausal symptoms, your overall health, and any potential risks associated with stopping the treatment. Please schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns and options.","Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system

"Ear Wax.. 
				I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Using hydrogen peroxide to help remove earwax can be effective, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind. 

1. **Concentration**: Ensure that you are using a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide (typically around 3%). Higher concentrations can be irritating to the skin in the ear canal.

2. **Bubbling Action**: The bubbling action of hydrogen peroxide can help to break down earwax, but it may also cause discomfort or a sensation of fullness in the ear. If you experience pain or significant discomfort, you should stop the procedure.

3. **Flushing with Water**: After using hydrogen peroxide, flushing the ear with warm water can help remove loosened wax. However, be cautious not to use too much force, as this can damage the ear canal or eardrum.

4. **Frequency**: Regular use of hydrogen peroxide for earwax removal is not generally recommended. If you find that you need to do this frequently, it may be a sign of excessive earwax production or another underlying issue.

5. **Consult a Professional**: If you have a history of ear problems, such as ear infections or a perforated eardrum, or if you are unsure about the safety of this method for your specific situation, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional before proceeding.

In summary, while using hydrogen peroxide can be safe for occasional earwax removal, it is important to use it correctly and to be aware of any discomfort or complications that may arise. If in doubt, seek advice from a healthcare provider.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most
					effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment."
"Sevoflurane. 
				I work in a hospital, and a question recently came up regarding the stability of Sevoflurane once it has been opened. Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","Physician: Sevoflurane, like many medical products, has a specific expiration date assigned by the manufacturer. This date indicates the time until which the product is expected to retain its properties and effectiveness when stored properly. Once opened, the stability of Sevoflurane may be affected by various factors, including exposure to air and light. It is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding the use of Sevoflurane after opening, as it may not remain effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle. Always check for any specific recommendations regarding the shelf life of the product once it has been opened.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride). In rats, this emulsion was an effective anesthetic and was not associated with adverse events. The emulsion was stable after consecutive evaluation for 365 days and for 180
					minutes after the vial was opened.. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium

"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral disorder that typically develops in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedient, negative, and agitated behavior, often directed towards authority figures. Unlike conduct disorder, individuals with ODD do not usually exhibit aggressive behaviors, destruction of property, theft, or deceit. Common symptoms include a quarrelsome attitude, being vengeful, and an overall negative mood.

It's important to note that ODD can co-occur with other disorders, such as Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Treatment often involves behavioral therapy, and in some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.

If you have specific questions or concerns about ODD, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical abnormalities and an increased risk of certain cancers. The primary features of BWS include:

1. **Umbilical Hernia**: A condition where part of the intestine protrudes through the abdominal wall near the belly button.
2. **Macroglossia**: An enlarged tongue, which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.
3. **Gigantism**: Increased growth rate, often resulting in larger-than-average size for age.

In addition to these primary characteristics, individuals with BWS may also experience secondary features such as:

- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of internal organs.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous if not managed properly.
- **Ear Abnormalities**: Various ear shape or size issues.

BWS is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means it is part of a group of syndromes that can lead to excessive growth and an increased risk of malignancies. The condition is often associated with genetic mutations, particularly involving the CDKN1C gene, which plays a role in cell cycle regulation.

Management of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including regular monitoring for potential complications, nutritional support, and addressing any specific health issues that arise.

If you have any specific questions or need more detailed information about a particular aspect of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."

				CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.
				Does ciprofaxin work well? Is there a better drug if so what.","Ciprofloxacin is generally effective against a range of bacterial infections, including those caused by Citrobacter freundii. However, antibiotic resistance can be a concern with this organism, and its susceptibility to ciprofloxacin may vary. 

If ciprofloxacin is not effective or if there is a concern about resistance, alternative treatment options may include other antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or meropenem, depending on the specific susceptibility profile of the bacteria. It's important to perform susceptibility testing to determine the most effective antibiotic for your specific case. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.","There are no comparative studies of antibiotic therapy for Citrobacter infections. Thus, treatment of Citrobacter infections follows the principles for treatment of other Enterobacteriaceae infections. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities described above,
					aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and the fourth-generation cephems, such as cefepime and cefpirome, would appear to be preferred therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections.. Citrobacter species are a common cause of nosocomial infections associated with patients that are undergoing prolonged hospital treatments. C. freundii has recently been reported to express resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotincs including piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam,
					vancomycin and cephalosporins. Isolation of ceftriaxone-resistant Citrobacter freundii (CRCF) has been associated with the overprescribed broad spectrum antibiotics.. The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins."

Given the history of prolonged car seat use leading to a flat head and the concerns about his back and sitting posture, I recommend seeing a pediatric physical therapist or a pediatric orthopedic specialist. They can assess his posture, spinal alignment, and overall musculoskeletal health. Additionally, they can provide guidance on exercises or interventions that may help improve his sitting position and prevent any further issues. If you have ongoing concerns, it may also be helpful to seek a second opinion from another pediatrician who specializes in developmental issues.","The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain.

This morning he woke up with a bit of blood drainage. Is that normal?","It's not uncommon for some drainage to occur with otitis media, especially if there is a rupture of the eardrum or if there is fluid accumulation in the middle ear. The presence of blood in the drainage can be concerning, but it can also happen in some cases of ear infections. Since your son is already being treated with amoxicillin and antipyrine-benzocaine ear drops, it's important to monitor the situation closely. 

If the drainage continues, increases in volume, or if your son experiences worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, I recommend bringing him in for a follow-up examination. It’s always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to ear infections and any associated symptoms.","With a severe ear infection, pressure may build up and cause the eardrum to rupture. Pus and blood may drain out. This usually relieves pain and pressure, and in most cases the eardrum heals on its own.. Middle ear infections may cause pain, hearing loss, and spontaneous rupture of the eardrum, resulting in a perforation. In this case,there may be infected or bloody drainage from the ear.

reaction to these 2 drugs. I would like to know if there are any drug reaction between Carvedilol 25 mg to Hydrslazine50 mg,"The combination of Carvedilol and Hydralazine can potentially lead to additive effects on blood pressure, as both medications are antihypertensive agents. Carvedilol is a non-cardioselective beta blocker and vasodilator, while Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator. When used together, they may enhance the hypotensive effects, leading to an increased risk of low blood pressure (hypotension). 

It is important to monitor the patient closely for signs of excessive hypotension, especially when initiating therapy or adjusting doses. Additionally, patients should be advised to report any symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have genetic components, particularly in certain types like Alzheimer's disease, which may run in families. However, it is not solely determined by genetics; various risk factors, including lifestyle and environmental influences, also play a significant role. While some individuals may have a hereditary predisposition to dementia, it is possible for anyone to develop the condition regardless of their family history.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease

Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options available for treating sleep apnea, particularly for obstructive sleep apnea. One common procedure is called palatopharyngoplasty, which involves removing excess tissue from the throat to widen the airway. This can help reduce or eliminate the obstructions that cause apneas during sleep. 

Given your husband's history, including his stroke and heart surgery, it's essential to consult with a specialist who can evaluate his specific situation and determine the most appropriate treatment options. A sleep specialist or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor would be a good starting point for discussing surgical options. They can also explore other alternatives if surgery is not suitable.","Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP.

Diahrrea . I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea. Then I stop it for about 2 days so I can have a bowel movement. But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge when managing chronic diarrhea with loperamide. While loperamide can help reduce the frequency of bowel movements, it can also lead to softer stools or difficulty in having a bowel movement if used continuously. 

To find a happy medium, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adjust Dosage**: You might need to adjust the dosage of loperamide. Instead of stopping it completely, you could try a lower dose that still helps manage your symptoms without causing constipation.

2. **Dietary Changes**: Incorporate foods that can help firm up your stool, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet). Avoid high-fiber foods and dairy products, which can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea.

3. **Hydration**: Ensure you are staying well-hydrated, especially if you are experiencing diarrhea. Electrolyte solutions can be beneficial.

4. **Consult Your Physician**: It's important to discuss your symptoms and management plan with your physician. They may suggest alternative medications or therapies that can help balance your bowel movements more effectively.

5. **Monitor Stool Consistency**: Keep track of your stool consistency and frequency. This information can help your physician make more informed recommendations.

Finding the right balance may take some time, so be patient and work closely with your healthcare provider to adjust your treatment plan as needed.","IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule
					Chronic Diarrhea
					Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may
					then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
					The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further
					administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered."
"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Yes, uveitis can be associated with autoimmune diseases. It is an inflammation of the uvea, which can occur due to various underlying conditions, including autoimmune disorders. In some cases, the immune system mistakenly attacks the eye's tissues, leading to uveitis. Conditions such as Behcet's syndrome, which is an autoimmune disease, are known to cause uveitis. Therefore, while not all uveitis is due to autoimmune diseases, there is a significant relationship between the two.","Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue

While there isn't a specific ""weaning process"" for amlodipine like there is for some medications, it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely during the switch. 

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, and atenolol is a beta-1 adrenergic blocker. When switching from one to the other, your physician may recommend gradually reducing the dose of amlodipine while starting atenolol at a low dose, then adjusting as needed based on your response. 

Make sure to discuss your concerns about the high pause rate with your physician, as they may want to monitor you more closely during this transition. Always follow your physician's guidance on how to adjust your medications safely.","Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks. Do not abruptly discontinue without physician's advice.. If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks, do not suddenly stop using it.

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"It's understandable to be concerned after such an incident. Exposure to blood can carry risks, including the transmission of HIV, especially if the blood is from someone who is HIV positive. However, the risk of HIV transmission through blood exposure depends on several factors, including the amount of blood, the presence of open wounds or mucous membranes, and the HIV status of the person whose blood was involved.

Since you mentioned that you had blood splashed on your hand and face, and that you didn't wash it immediately, there is a potential risk. It's important to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible for an evaluation. They may recommend testing for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if appropriate. 

In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid any further exposure. Remember, early intervention can be crucial in managing potential risks.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."

congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is primarily caused by embryologic defects in the diaphragm, which can lead to the protrusion of abdominal structures into the thorax. The exact causes of CDH are not fully understood, but it can be associated with genetic factors, environmental influences, and maternal health conditions during pregnancy. 

Cousin marriage can increase the risk of congenital conditions, including CDH, due to the potential for inherited genetic factors. If there are known genetic disorders in the family, this could contribute to the likelihood of congenital anomalies in offspring.

As for lung diseases, babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia often experience pulmonary hypoplasia, which is a condition where the lung parenchyma is underdeveloped. This can lead to long-term respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. The severity of these conditions can vary based on the extent of the hernia and associated complications. Early intervention and management are crucial for improving outcomes.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","When it comes to handling food in a workplace setting, it's important to consider the implications of shingles (herpes zoster). Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. While shingles itself is not directly transmitted through food, the virus can be spread through direct contact with the fluid from the blisters that occur during a shingles outbreak.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Transmission Risk**: If a person with shingles has open blisters, there is a risk of transmitting the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox or has not been vaccinated against it. This can lead to chickenpox in susceptible individuals.

2. **Food Handling Precautions**: It is advisable for individuals with shingles to avoid direct contact with food and to refrain from food handling until the blisters have crusted over and are no longer infectious. This is particularly important in a workplace where food is prepared or served.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: Good hygiene practices should be followed, including frequent handwashing and using gloves when necessary. If a worker has shingles, they should inform their supervisor and may need to take time off until they are no longer contagious.

4. **Vaccination**: Encourage employees to get vaccinated against shingles if they are eligible, as this can help reduce the risk of outbreaks in the workplace.

In summary, while shingles does not pose a direct risk through food, it is essential to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in food handling environments.","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
			. My question to you is: what is the reason that there is very little attentions is to Antiphosoholipid Syndrome? To find the causes and possibly some type of cure for us who struggle with this auto-immune blood disorder? I guess that since it is female directed (9-1 female to male) that
				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","Physician: Thank you for your question and for sharing your experience. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is indeed a complex autoimmune disorder that can lead to serious complications, including thrombosis and pregnancy-related issues. While it predominantly affects women, particularly during their reproductive years, it is important to recognize that it can also affect men, as you mentioned.

The relative lack of attention to APS in research may be due to several factors. One reason could be its association with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, which often receive more focus in clinical research. Additionally, the rarity of APS compared to other conditions may result in fewer resources being allocated for its study.

However, awareness is growing, and there are ongoing efforts to better understand APS, its causes, and potential treatments. Clinical trials are essential for advancing our knowledge and finding effective therapies. If you're interested, I encourage you to look into clinical trials related to APS on platforms like ClinicalTrials.gov, as they may provide opportunities for participation in research aimed at improving outcomes for individuals with this condition. Your voice and experience can contribute to the understanding and treatment of APS.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is recommended to be taken in the evening because cholesterol synthesis in the liver is highest at night. By taking simvastatin in the evening, you can maximize its effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. 

Taking simvastatin in the morning may not cause harm, but it could potentially reduce the medication's effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels. If you have any concerns or specific circumstances, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."
"Prednisone	. My husband has been on Prednisone for almost a year for a Cancer treatment he had. He started at 30mg and stayed on 10mg until a couple weeks ago. The prednisone was causing other side effects. He reduced down to 5mg for a couple days and now has been off the prednisone for a week. How
				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","Physician: It's important to understand that prednisone is a corticosteroid, and when someone has been on it for an extended period, like your husband, they may experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping the medication. The symptoms you're describing, such as chills, fever, and abdominal pain, can be associated with steroid withdrawal syndrome. 

The duration that prednisone stays in the system can vary, but generally, it has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours, meaning it can be cleared from the body relatively quickly. However, the physiological effects and potential withdrawal symptoms can last longer, especially after long-term use.

Since your husband has been on prednisone for almost a year, it's possible that his body is adjusting to the absence of the medication, which can lead to symptoms of adrenal cortical hypofunction. This occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol after stopping corticosteroids. 

It's crucial to monitor his symptoms closely. If they persist or worsen, or if he experiences severe symptoms, I recommend contacting his healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may consider a gradual tapering of the medication rather than stopping abruptly, which can help mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, they can assess for any other underlying issues that may be contributing to his discomfort.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug. If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your
					body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual
					symptoms while you are taking decreasing doses of prednisone or after you stop taking the medication."

Schmorl's Nodes. I am trying to obtain information on subject matter.,"Schmorl's nodes are a condition characterized by the herniation of the nucleus pulposus, which is the inner gel-like core of an intervertebral disc, through the cartilaginous and bony end plate into the body of the adjacent vertebra. This can occur in various regions of the spine, including the thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral areas. 

While Schmorl's nodes are often asymptomatic, they can be associated with back pain and are considered a type of orthopedic disorder of the spine. They may also be related to intervertebral disc degeneration, which involves degenerative changes in the intervertebral disc due to aging or structural damage, particularly affecting the vertebral end-plates.

If you have specific concerns or symptoms related to Schmorl's nodes, it would be beneficial to discuss them further with your physician, who can provide tailored advice and potential treatment options.","Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra.

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics
			. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',
				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great to hear that you're looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, especially considering your history of being active. However, managing asthma while exercising can be challenging, and it's important to choose activities that minimize the risk of triggering symptoms like dyspnea (difficulty breathing) or airway obstruction.

Here are some exercise recommendations for individuals with asthma, particularly those who are overweight:

1. **Aerobic Exercises**: Low-impact aerobic activities can be beneficial. Consider options like walking, swimming, or cycling at a moderate pace. These activities can help improve cardiovascular fitness without putting too much strain on your respiratory system.

2. **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always start with a gentle warm-up to prepare your lungs and muscles for exercise. Similarly, a cool-down period can help your body transition back to rest.

3. **Controlled Breathing Techniques**: Incorporate breathing exercises into your routine. Techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing can help improve your lung capacity and control your breathing during physical activity.

4. **Indoor Activities**: If outdoor conditions (like cold air or pollen) trigger your asthma, consider indoor exercises such as yoga or using a stationary bike. These can help you stay active without exposure to potential triggers.

5. **Monitor Your Symptoms**: Keep track of how you feel during and after exercise. If you experience any signs of asthma exacerbation, such as wheezing or chest tightness, stop the activity and use your rescue inhaler if prescribed.

6. **Consult with a Healthcare Provider**: Before starting any new exercise program, it's a good idea to discuss your plans with your physician or a respiratory therapist. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific condition and needs.

7. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to help keep your airways moist and reduce the risk of asthma symptoms.

Remember, the goal is to find activities that you enjoy and can do safely. With the right approach, you can manage your asthma while staying active and improving your overall health.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey. Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

					The trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...
					One recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...
					One study found that people who practiced Hatha yoga two-and-a-half hours a week for 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. The same benefit would probably result from Tai Chi, a martial art that also emphasizes breathing, says Dr. Graham. ..."

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle branch block is a form of heart block where the electrical stimulation of the heart ventricles is interrupted at one of the branches of the Bundle of His. This interruption prevents the simultaneous depolarization of the two ventricles, which can affect the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently.

**Symptoms:**
Symptoms of bundle branch block can vary. Some individuals may not experience any symptoms, while others may have:
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain or discomfort

**Diagnosis and Monitoring:**
Bundle branch block is often diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart and can reveal the presence of the block.

**Treatment:**
Treatment for bundle branch block depends on the underlying cause and the presence of symptoms. If the block is asymptomatic and not associated with other heart conditions, it may not require any specific treatment. However, if symptoms are present or if there are other heart issues, treatment options may include:
- Medications to manage symptoms or underlying heart conditions
- Pacemaker implantation in cases where the block leads to significant heart rhythm issues

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)"
general health. I have an infection in gums...dentist prescribed Cephalexin 500mg...Is this ok to take even though I am ALLERGIC TO PENICILLAN?,"Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which is structurally different from penicillin. While there is a possibility of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, it is generally considered safe for individuals with a penicillin allergy to take cephalexin. However, it is important to inform your dentist or physician about your allergy, as they can provide personalized advice and monitor you for any potential allergic reactions. If you have had severe reactions to penicillin in the past, it may be prudent to discuss alternative antibiotics with your healthcare provider.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Arrhythmia can indeed occur after an ablation procedure, as the heart may take time to heal and adjust following the intervention. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but many studies suggest that it can be effective in reducing or eliminating arrhythmias in a significant percentage of patients.

Regarding your Holter monitor test results, a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21 is quite concerning. A heart rate of 254 indicates a very high rate, which could be a sign of a serious arrhythmia, while a rate of 21 is extremely low and could indicate bradycardia, which can also be dangerous. It is essential to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider, as they can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and recommend appropriate management based on your specific situation.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil citrate, which is the same active ingredient found in Viagra. Both medications are classified as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and work in a similar manner to treat erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow to the penis, facilitating an erection when sexual stimulation occurs.

However, it's important to note that while Fildena may be similar in its active ingredient and mechanism of action, it is not FDA approved. This means that it has not undergone the same rigorous testing and evaluation for safety and efficacy as Viagra. The lack of FDA approval can raise concerns about the quality, consistency, and potential side effects of the medication.

If you are considering using Fildena as an alternative to Viagra, it is crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on the safety and appropriateness of using Fildena, as well as explore other potential treatment options for erectile dysfunction that may be covered by your insurance.","Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications
					Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you
					to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.. Fildena contains Sildenafil Citrate, a common ingredient used in various leading branded ED pills like kamagra etc. and which are available over the counter. Sildenafil Citrate was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharma. Sildenafil
					Citrate helps treat erectile dysfunction (trouble having an erection). Helps a man have an erection or have a better erection with his penis during sex. It also treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in both men and women.

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While traditional treatments for severe depression typically include antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, and other therapeutic interventions, low-dose naltrexone has been explored as a potential option due to its effects on the immune system and neuroinflammation, which may play a role in mood disorders.

To determine if there are specific clinical trials investigating the efficacy of low-dose naltrexone for severe depression, I recommend searching ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing or completed studies. You can look for keywords such as ""low-dose naltrexone"" and ""severe depression"" to find relevant trials. Additionally, reviewing the results of these studies can provide insights into its safety and effectiveness for this condition.","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be transmitted through various means, primarily through contact with infected bodily fluids. The most common modes of transmission include:

1. **Blood-Borne Transmission**: Hepatitis viruses, particularly Hepatitis B and C, can be spread through contact with infected blood. This can occur through sharing needles, transfusions of contaminated blood, or exposure to blood in healthcare settings.

2. **Sexual Transmission**: Hepatitis B can also be transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person.

3. **Vertical Transmission**: This refers to the transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth.

4. **Contaminated Food and Water**: Hepatitis A is often spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, particularly in areas with poor sanitation.

5. **Close Contact**: In some cases, close personal contact with an infected person can lead to transmission, especially for Hepatitis A.

It's important to practice safe hygiene and take preventive measures, such as vaccination for Hepatitis A and B, to reduce the risk of infection.","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other
					injection drug equipment
					* Needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or tinea cruris, is a fungal infection that typically affects the groin area, including the scrotum. While it can cause itching, redness, and a rash, small lumps under the skin around the scrotum are not a common symptom of jock itch. These lumps could be related to other conditions, such as cysts, infections, or other dermatological issues. It's important to have any new or unusual lumps evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine their cause and whether treatment is necessary. If you're experiencing discomfort or have concerns, I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

general health. What are the causes of rib cage pain? And and the remedy,"Rib cage pain can arise from various causes, including:

1. **Tietze's Syndrome**: This condition involves idiopathic painful swellings of the costal cartilages, particularly the second rib, and can mimic chest pain associated with coronary artery disease.

2. **Pleurisy**: Inflammation of the pleura, the lining of the lungs, can lead to sharp chest pain, especially when breathing deeply or coughing.

3. **Musculoskeletal Pain**: Discomfort stemming from muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bones can also cause pain in the rib cage area.

4. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The retrograde flow of gastric acid into the esophagus can cause chest pain that may be mistaken for rib cage pain.

**Remedies** may vary depending on the underlying cause but can include:

- **Rest and Ice**: For musculoskeletal pain, resting the affected area and applying ice can help reduce inflammation and discomfort.
- **Anti-inflammatory Medications**: Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen can alleviate pain and inflammation.
- **Physical Therapy**: For musculoskeletal issues, physical therapy may be beneficial.
- **Treating Underlying Conditions**: For conditions like pleurisy or GERD, addressing the underlying issue with appropriate medical treatment is essential.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on the specific cause of rib cage pain.","Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
					Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
					Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis)
					Osteoporosis
					Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
					Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.

					Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain."

If you have concerns about symptoms you are experiencing, please consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main

"Frequency	. My urologist has prescribed Oxybutinin, 5 mg tablets, NOT in the ER version. I understood they were to be taken once a day, but he has prescribed twice. Is this the correct recommended dosage, or should the prescription have been for once a day?","The recommended dosage of Oxybutynin can vary based on the specific formulation and the patient's individual needs. While the extended-release (ER) version is typically taken once a day, the immediate-release (IR) version, such as the 5 mg tablets your urologist prescribed, is often taken multiple times a day. 

In your case, taking the 5 mg tablets twice a day is a common practice for the immediate-release formulation. However, it's always best to follow your urologist's specific instructions and clarify any concerns directly with them to ensure the dosage is appropriate for your condition.","Adults
					The usual dose is one 5-mg tablet two to three times a day. The maximum recommended dose is one 5-mg tablet four times a day. A lower starting dose of 2.5 mg two or three times a day is recommended for the frail elderly."

Both medications can affect the central nervous system, and taking them together may increase the risk of side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. In some cases, this combination can lead to more serious effects, including respiratory depression.

If you find that taking them separately does not provide relief, it's crucial to discuss this with your physician. They can evaluate your specific situation, consider your medical history, and determine the best approach for managing your pain safely. Never adjust your medication regimen without consulting your healthcare provider.","1.

Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to note the following:

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: Taking diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) with lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) can potentially reduce the effectiveness of lisinopril. NSAIDs like diclofenac may lead to kidney issues, which can further affect blood pressure control. Therefore, caution is advised, and monitoring by a healthcare provider is recommended.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and naproxen are NSAIDs. Taking them together can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, as well as kidney problems. It is generally not recommended to use two NSAIDs simultaneously.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: Acetaminophen can usually be taken with diclofenac, as they work through different mechanisms. However, it is essential to adhere to the recommended dosages for both medications to avoid potential liver damage from excessive acetaminophen use.

In summary, while diclofenac can be taken with acetaminophen, caution should be exercised when combining it with lisinopril or other NSAIDs like naproxen. Always consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

					Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL
					BLEEDING, ULCERATION, PERFORATION and DRUG INTERACTIONS). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in ""over the counter"" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.. Some foods and medicines may affect how lisinopril works. Tell your doctor if you are using any of the following:

					Aliskiren, everolimus, lithium, sirolimus, temsirolimus
					Another blood pressure medicine, including an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
					Diuretic (water pill, including amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene)

"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a serious genetic condition that can lead to a variety of severe abnormalities. The progression of the disease can vary significantly among individuals. Generally, the condition is associated with a high rate of mortality in infancy, and many affected individuals may not survive beyond their first year of life. For those who do survive, the progression can involve worsening health issues, including developmental delays and physical abnormalities.

As for diagnosing Patau syndrome, it typically involves genetic testing to confirm the presence of an extra chromosome 13. This can be done through various methods, including karyotyping, which analyzes the number and structure of chromosomes. Additionally, prenatal screening tests may also indicate the likelihood of trisomy 13, allowing for further diagnostic testing if needed.

If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask!","Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body.

"quinine in seltzer water.. quinine in seltzer water.
				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct ""dosage""? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.","Yes, quinine can be used to help ease leg cramps, as it has been noted for its effectiveness in treating muscular disorders, including nocturnal leg cramps. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before using quinine, especially regarding the appropriate dosage and potential side effects.

As for the dosage, quinine is typically administered in specific amounts, and the exact dosage can vary based on individual health conditions and the formulation used. Quinine sulfate is a common form, and the standard dosage for leg cramps is often around 200-300 mg taken at bedtime, but this can vary. 

Since you mentioned that quinine in seltzer water helps ease your leg cramps, it would be best to check with your physician for personalized advice on the dosage and to ensure it is safe for you, especially considering any potential contraindications or adverse effects.","Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

					The evidence is current to October 2014."
"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For the treatment of mite infestation, particularly cutaneous acariasis caused by Sarcoptes scabiei or other mites, the following non-toxic or low-side-effect options are generally recommended:

1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: A topical insecticide that is effective against scabies mites. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects.
   - **Benzyl Benzoate**: Another topical treatment that can be used, though it may cause skin irritation in some individuals.

2. **Oral Medications**: 
   - **Ivermectin**: An oral medication that can be effective for severe cases of scabies. It is usually well-tolerated, but it is important to consult with a healthcare provider regarding its use.

3. **Symptomatic Relief**: 
   - **Antihistamines**: These can help relieve itching and discomfort associated with mite infestations.
   - **Moisturizers**: Applying soothing creams or lotions can help alleviate skin irritation.

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. **Hygiene Practices**: 
   - Regular bathing and washing of clothes and bedding in hot water can help eliminate mites.
   - Vacuuming living spaces frequently to remove any potential mites.

2. **Avoiding Close Contact**: 
   - Limit close contact with individuals who have a known mite infestation until they have been treated.

3. **Environmental Control**: 
   - Treating pets and ensuring that they are free from mites, as some types can be transmitted from animals to humans.

4. **Education**: 
   - Being aware of the signs and symptoms of mite infestations can lead to early detection and treatment.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and to ensure that the chosen treatment is appropriate for your specific situation.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."
meds taken with wine at dinnertime. Is it safe to take my meds with wine at dinnertime?,"It is generally not safe to take medications with wine or any alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can interact with many medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of adverse effects. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider or pharmacist about specific medications you are taking to understand any potential drug interactions with alcohol. Always prioritize safety and follow professional medical advice regarding medication and alcohol consumption.","Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can
					make it dangerous to drive, and when you mix alcohol with certain medicines you put yourself at even greater risk. Combining alcohol with some medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries, especially among older people."

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Prematurity**: Newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation may have immature metabolic systems, leading to difficulties in maintaining normal blood glucose levels.
2. **Low Birth Weight**: Infants with low birth weight may have less glycogen stored in their liver, making them more susceptible to hypoglycemia.
3. **Maternal Diabetes**: Infants born to mothers with diabetes (including gestational diabetes) may experience hypoglycemia after birth due to high insulin levels.
4. **Inadequate Feeding**: Delayed or insufficient feeding after birth can lead to low blood sugar levels in newborns.
5. **Infections or Illness**: Any underlying health issues or infections can affect a newborn's ability to regulate blood sugar.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Manage Blood Sugar Levels**: If the mother has diabetes, it is crucial to maintain good blood sugar control throughout pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications for the baby.
2. **Regular Prenatal Care**: Attending all prenatal appointments allows for monitoring of the mother’s and baby’s health, including screening for gestational diabetes.
3. **Healthy Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in nutrients can help support the baby's growth and development, ensuring adequate energy stores.
4. **Educate on Feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed promptly and adequately, whether through breastfeeding or formula feeding, to maintain stable blood glucose levels.
5. **Monitor for Symptoms**: Be aware of signs of hypoglycemia in the newborn, such as jitteriness, lethargy, or poor feeding, and seek medical attention if these occur.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, a CT scan (X-Ray Computed Tomography) can detect both diverticulosis and diverticulitis, even in the absence of an active infection. Diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of multiple diverticula in the walls of the intestine, which can be visualized on a CT scan. Diverticulitis, on the other hand, involves inflammation of these diverticula, and while the scan can show signs of inflammation, it can also identify diverticula themselves regardless of whether there is an infection present at that time.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by cold viruses while others are not can be attributed to several factors, including their immune response and disease susceptibility. 

1. **Immune Response**: Individuals with a strong immune response are better equipped to fend off infections, including those caused by cold viruses. The immune system's ability to recognize and combat pathogens varies from person to person, influenced by genetics and overall health.

2. **Disease Susceptibility**: Some people may have a constitution or condition that makes them more susceptible to infections. This can be due to various factors, such as pre-existing health conditions, age, or lifestyle choices that affect their immune function.

In summary, while contagion plays a role in the transmission of cold viruses, the likelihood of becoming ill also depends on an individual's immune response and susceptibility to disease.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg- 1 daily. Doctor prescribed for type 2 diabetes w/Metformin 500 mg 2 times daily. Pharmacy refused to fill stating overdose of Metformin. Who is right & what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Pharmacy is a non-public pharmacy for a major city employer plan provided for employees only.,"The physician is correct in prescribing Janumet XR 50mg/1000mg once daily, which contains 1000mg of Metformin and 50mg of Sitagliptin. However, the patient is also taking an additional 500mg of Metformin twice daily, which totals 1000mg of Metformin from that source as well. This results in a total daily dosage of 2000mg of Metformin (1000mg from Janumet XR and 1000mg from the additional Metformin).

The maximum recommended daily dosage of Metformin for most adults is typically 2000mg to 2500mg, depending on the specific formulation and individual patient factors. Therefore, the total dosage of 2000mg is at the upper limit of the recommended range, but it is not necessarily an overdose.

The pharmacy may have refused to fill the prescription due to concerns about exceeding the maximum dosage, but based on standard guidelines, the physician's prescription does not constitute an overdose. It would be advisable for the patient to discuss this with their physician and possibly have the physician communicate with the pharmacy to clarify the situation.",The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets are 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).
SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) typically occurs in children and young adults, usually 2-8 years after a measles infection. While it is rare, the condition is primarily associated with individuals who have had measles, particularly those who did not receive the measles vaccination. 

In your son's case, since he is 33 years old and did not have the measles vaccination, he may not have had a prior measles infection, which significantly reduces the risk of developing SSPE. However, if he were to contract measles at any point, there is a possibility that SSPE could develop years later. 

It is important to discuss vaccination options with a healthcare provider, as vaccination can prevent measles and, consequently, the risk of SSPE.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","Physician: It's understandable to be concerned about your granddaughter's condition. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a complex vascular disorder that can affect the limbs, and it often involves a combination of symptoms such as port-wine stains, varicose veins, and lymphatic malformations. 

Currently, treatment options for KTS are focused on managing symptoms and may include:

1. **Symptom Management**: This involves supportive care to help your granddaughter cope with the effects of the syndrome. It may include physical therapy to improve mobility and reduce discomfort, as well as strategies to manage any swelling or pain in her affected leg.

2. **Surgical Interventions**: In some cases, surgical options may be considered to address significant vascular malformations or to improve function and appearance. This would depend on the severity of her symptoms and the specific characteristics of her condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: It's important to have regular check-ups with a specialist who understands KTS, as this will help in monitoring her condition and adjusting treatment as necessary.

4. **Research and Clinical Trials**: There may be ongoing research studies or clinical trials that focus on KTS. I recommend checking resources like ClinicalTrials.gov for the latest information on studies that might be relevant to her condition.

I suggest consulting with a pediatric vascular specialist or a geneticist who has experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. They can provide more personalized guidance and help you explore the best options for your granddaughter's care.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."

Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"In the case of inherited ricketts, if the mother has the condition and is passing it to one child (A) but not to another child (B), it suggests that the inheritance pattern may not be straightforward. 

If we consider the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance, which is common for many genetic conditions, each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Since child A has inherited the condition, it indicates that they received the mutant allele from the mother. Child B, who did not inherit the condition, would not pass it on to their children, as they do not carry the mutant allele.

Therefore, if child B does not have the condition, they would not be able to pass it on to their own children. The likelihood of child B passing the condition to their child is 0%.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."
"Medicare Part B coverage. I suffer with acute fibromyalgia (sp?) and the various drugs my doctor has prescribed for me have little if any effect in helping to control the pain. My doctor has since given me a prescription to have massage therapy which she thought medicare would cover. However, when checking with
				medicare, it turns out that it does not! Can you suggest any other type of treatment?","Given your situation with fibromyalgia and the limited effectiveness of prescription medications, there are several alternative treatment options you might consider:

1. **Pain Management Programs**: These programs take a coordinated approach to help manage pain and improve quality of life. They often include a combination of therapies, including physical therapy, counseling, and medication management.

2. **Alternative Therapies**: You might explore alternative therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, or tai chi, which have been reported to help some individuals with fibromyalgia symptoms.

3. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This type of therapy can help address the psychological aspects of chronic pain and may improve coping strategies.

4. **Physical Therapy**: A physical therapist can design a personalized exercise program that focuses on improving strength, flexibility, and overall function, which may help alleviate some symptoms.

5. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Incorporating regular low-impact exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and practicing good sleep hygiene can also be beneficial in managing fibromyalgia symptoms.

6. **Massage Therapy**: While Medicare may not cover it, you could consider seeking out massage therapy as a self-pay option, as many patients find it helpful for muscle tension and pain relief.

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR gene, particularly the A1298C variant, is associated with various health issues, primarily related to folate metabolism and homocysteine levels. Being homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant means that an individual has two copies of this allele, which can potentially lead to reduced enzyme activity. This reduction may result in elevated homocysteine levels, which have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and complications during pregnancy.

In terms of long-term prognosis, individuals who are homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant may benefit from monitoring their homocysteine levels and ensuring adequate intake of folate and other B vitamins, which can help mitigate some of the risks associated with this genetic variant. Lifestyle modifications, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also play a crucial role in managing health outcomes.

It's important to approach this condition on a case-by-case basis, as the impact of the homozygous MTHFR A1298C variant can vary among individuals. Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers and possibly genetic counseling may be advisable to address any specific health concerns and to develop a personalized management plan.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can lead to various side effects, including gastrointestinal issues like flatulence. While Vitamin D is essential for maintaining calcium levels and preventing deficiencies, excessive intake can result in toxicity, which may manifest as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and other symptoms. 

Regarding safety, such high doses are sometimes prescribed for individuals with very low Vitamin D levels, but this should always be done under medical supervision. It's crucial to monitor blood levels and adjust the dosage accordingly to avoid potential adverse effects. Always consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to your Vitamin D intake.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To prevent a shingles outbreak, the most effective method is vaccination. The shingles vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of developing shingles and its complications. It's recommended for adults, especially those over the age of 50 or individuals with weakened immune systems. 

Additionally, maintaining a healthy immune system through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing stress can also help reduce the likelihood of an outbreak.

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and cysts, especially with your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While CVID itself does not directly increase the risk of thyroid cancer, having a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm does warrant careful monitoring. 

Thyroid tumors can vary in their potential for malignancy, and the size of the tumor is one of the factors that can influence this. Generally, tumors larger than 1 cm may have a higher likelihood of being cancerous, but many are benign. Your endocrinologist will be able to provide the best guidance based on the specific characteristics of your tumor and cysts.

As for statistics, the risk of thyroid cancer is generally low, but it can vary based on factors such as age, gender, and family history. Regular monitoring and follow-up with your endocrinologist are crucial to ensure any changes are detected early. If you have specific concerns about your risk or the monitoring process, I recommend discussing them directly with your endocrinologist, who can provide tailored information based on your situation.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the

diabete. whats diabete,"Diabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a group of disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and glucose intolerance. There are different types of diabetes, primarily classified into two main categories: 

1. **Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1)**: This type is characterized by insulin deficiency, often leading to severe hyperglycemia and requiring insulin treatment. It typically has a sudden onset and is most common in children and adolescents.

2. **Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2)**: This type is characterized by insulin resistance and is often associated with obesity. It can occur at any age and is not exclusively found in adults. Patients may not require insulin treatment initially.

Both types of diabetes can lead to various complications if not managed properly, including diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and other health issues. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes, monitoring blood sugar levels, and, in some cases, medication or insulin therapy.","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."
wellbutrin xl 150. how to taper off,"When tapering off Wellbutrin XL (bupropion hydrochloride controlled-release), it's important to do so gradually to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms, including the potential for protracted antidepressant withdrawal syndrome. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Consult Your Physician**: Before making any changes to your medication regimen, discuss your plans with your healthcare provider. They can provide a personalized tapering schedule based on your specific situation.

2. **Gradual Reduction**: Typically, the dosage is reduced slowly over a period of weeks or months. For example, if you are currently taking 150 mg, your physician might suggest reducing to 100 mg for a period before discontinuing completely.

3. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep track of any withdrawal symptoms or changes in mood during the tapering process. This can help your physician adjust the tapering schedule if necessary.

4. **Supportive Care**: Engage in supportive therapies, such as counseling or support groups, to help manage any emotional or psychological challenges during the tapering process.

5. **Follow-Up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments with your physician to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your tapering plan.

Remember, the goal is to minimize discomfort and ensure a safe discontinuation of the medication.","1. he tapered off bupropion SR, taking 150 mg/day for 4 days followed by 150 mg every other day for 8 days (4 total doses) and 150 mg every third day for 6 days (2 total doses) without further complications.
					2. For patients taking 300 mg/day during the autumn-winter season, the dose should be tapered to 150 mg/day for 2 weeks prior to discontinuation.

Magnesium plays a crucial role in the metabolism of calcium and helps in the formation of bone. 

Regarding the Calcium Kirkland brand with Vitamin D, it can be a good choice for you, especially since Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption in the body. Since you have osteoporosis, ensuring adequate intake of both calcium and vitamin D is important for maintaining bone density and reducing the risk of fractures. 

However, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially considering your condition. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific health needs and any other medications you may be taking.","1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal.

"Consultation. Hello! I have acute chronic cervicitis caused by tampon use. It took a year and a half of treatment (medicines, cauterization), but the symptoms do not stop inflammation and analyzes not determined that bacteria produce inflammation me. I wonder if, despite not being a sexual cervicitis
				infection, it can cause infertility. And that's what makes a tampon that causes inflammation. Thank you very much!","Hello! Thank you for your question. Chronic cervicitis, even if not caused by a bacterial infection, can still have implications for fertility. Inflammation of the cervix can affect the cervical mucus, which plays a crucial role in sperm transport and can create an environment that is less favorable for conception. 

While your cervicitis is not due to a sexual infection, the inflammation itself can potentially contribute to infertility by disrupting normal reproductive processes. It's important to address the underlying inflammation and any associated symptoms. 

As for tampon use, it can sometimes lead to irritation or inflammation of the cervix, especially if they are used improperly or left in for too long. This irritation can exacerbate existing conditions like cervicitis. 

I recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider, who may suggest further evaluation or treatment options to manage your cervicitis and its potential impact on fertility.

"trisomy 7. trisomy 7. i am a 32 y/o who has had 4 miscarriages in the past 19 months. Upon my last DNC two weeks ago revealed a genetics study diagnosis of the baby having trisomy 7. could you offer me any information on this? could this have been maternal or paternal? is this something i would be
				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Trisomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 7 in somatic cells. This condition can be associated with various diseases, including certain types of cancer and congenital conditions. 

In your case, the diagnosis of trisomy 7 in your miscarried pregnancies could be due to a random error during cell division, which is often the case with chromosomal abnormalities. It is not typically inherited from parents, but rather occurs as a sporadic event. However, there are instances where a parent may carry a balanced translocation that could lead to an increased risk of having children with chromosomal abnormalities. 

As for whether you could be a carrier, it would be advisable to undergo genetic counseling and possibly genetic testing to determine if there are any underlying genetic factors that could be contributing to the miscarriages. 

The exact causes of trisomy 7 are not fully understood, but it is generally thought to arise from nondisjunction during meiosis, which is the process of cell division that produces eggs and sperm. Factors such as maternal age can influence the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, but at 32 years old, your age is not typically considered a high-risk factor.

If you have further questions or concerns, I recommend discussing them with a genetic counselor or a specialist in reproductive genetics who can provide more personalized information and support.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."
metformin. Does metformin cause high blood pressure?,"Metformin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is not typically associated with causing high blood pressure. In fact, some studies suggest that metformin may have a neutral or even beneficial effect on blood pressure in diabetic patients. However, individual responses can vary, and other factors such as lifestyle, diet, and coexisting medical conditions can influence blood pressure. If you have concerns about blood pressure while taking metformin, it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","1. This meta-analysis suggested that metformin could effectively lower SBP in nondiabetic patients, especially in those with impaired glucose tolerance or obesity.. 2.

There is no direct indication that aclidinium would pose a problem for a patient who may need cataract surgery within the next 12 months. However, it is always best to discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider, as they can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current medications.","1. Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.

					2. There are currently six muscarinic receptor antagonists licenced for use in the treatment of COPD, the short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMAs) ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) aclidinium bromide, tiotropium

intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine can have several detrimental effects on digestion and absorption in the body. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which can reduce blood flow to the intestines. This decreased circulation can impair the digestive process and hinder the absorption of nutrients.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to issues such as delayed gastric emptying or increased transit time in the intestines. This can result in digestive discomfort and affect nutrient absorption.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may alter the secretion of digestive enzymes and gastric acid, which are crucial for breaking down food. Insufficient enzyme activity can lead to malabsorption of nutrients.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smokers are at a higher risk for various gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel diseases. These conditions can further complicate digestion and absorption.

5. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can negatively impact the composition of gut microbiota, which plays a vital role in digestion and absorption. An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to digestive issues and affect overall health.

6. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Due to the combined effects of impaired digestion and absorption, smokers may experience deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which can have long-term health consequences.

In summary, smoking and nicotine can significantly disrupt the normal processes of digestion and absorption, leading to various gastrointestinal issues and nutrient deficiencies. It is advisable for individuals to consider these effects when evaluating their smoking habits and overall health.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa."
sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Yes, swelling in the feet, ankles, and legs can occur in individuals with fibromyalgia. While fibromyalgia is primarily characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, it can also be associated with other symptoms, including swelling. This swelling may be related to inflammation or fluid retention, which can sometimes accompany fibromyalgia. It's important to monitor your symptoms and discuss any new or worsening swelling with your healthcare provider to rule out other potential causes and to determine the best course of action for your treatment.","1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","Yes, there is a potential risk of infection when there is blood contact, especially if the needle was contaminated. While cancer itself does not spread through blood contact, certain infections can be transmitted this way. Since you accidentally pricked your finger with a needle that may have been used on a cancer patient, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection and consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. They may recommend testing or preventive measures based on the situation. Please take care and seek medical advice promptly.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities, especially if those activities are not appropriate for your age or physical condition. Engaging in high-impact exercises or standing for prolonged periods can increase stress on the plantar fascia, leading to more pain and inflammation.

In addition to weight-bearing activities, other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper support or cushioning can exacerbate the condition.
2. **Overuse**: Repeatedly engaging in activities that put strain on the feet, such as running or jumping, can lead to increased symptoms.
3. **Biomechanical Issues**: Conditions like flat feet or high arches can contribute to an imbalance that aggravates plantar fasciitis.
4. **Obesity**: Excess body weight can place additional stress on the plantar fascia.
5. **Tight Muscles**: Tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon can also lead to increased tension on the plantar fascia.

It's important to address these factors to help manage and alleviate the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. If you have further questions or need specific recommendations, feel free to ask!","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can potentially be detected during examinations of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly through imaging techniques or diagnostic procedures. 

Imaging techniques, such as endoscopic evaluations, can help visualize abnormalities in the upper GI tract, which may indicate the presence of metastatic disease affecting the lymph nodes or liver. Additionally, if there are signs of malignancy, further diagnostic procedures may be warranted to assess the lymph nodes or liver directly.

However, it's important to note that while the upper GI tract includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, the detection of lymph node involvement or liver cancer may require additional imaging or biopsy procedures beyond standard upper GI evaluations.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					anemia
					gastroesophageal reflux disease
					ulcers
					cancer
					inflammation, or swelling
					precancerous abnormalities
					celiac disease

					2. Tests for Liver Cancer

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

					Lab tests"
abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"Yes, an abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious complications, including an increased risk of heart problems such as endocarditis. The bacteria from the tooth infection can enter the bloodstream (a condition known as bacteremia) and may infect the heart valves, leading to endocarditis. If left untreated, endocarditis can damage the heart valves and may result in life-threatening conditions, including heart attacks. It is important to address dental infections promptly to prevent such complications.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"Ischemic syncope refers to a temporary loss of consciousness due to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, often caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), commonly known as a stroke. A TIA is characterized by brief, reversible episodes of focal, nonconvulsive ischemic dysfunction of the brain, lasting less than 24 hours, typically less than one hour, due to transient thrombotic or embolic occlusion of blood vessels. In contrast, a cerebrovascular accident involves a sudden loss of neurological function due to brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage, leading to tissue necrosis. Both conditions can result in symptoms such as hemiparesis or loss of motor function, and they may require prompt medical evaluation and intervention.","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Autoimmune illness. What doctor specializes in testing for and treatment of autoimmune illness?,"The physician who specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune illnesses is a Rheumatologist. Rheumatologists are medical doctors who focus on rheumatic diseases, which often include autoimmune conditions. They are trained to perform various diagnostic tests and provide treatments specific to these illnesses.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any

"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is known to potentially cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect. This occurs because venlafaxine, as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), can affect neurotransmitter levels that are crucial for sexual function. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed that increased serotonin levels can inhibit sexual arousal and function.

As for the minimum amount that may cause ED, it can vary significantly from person to person. Some individuals may experience sexual side effects at lower doses, while others may not experience any issues even at higher doses. Generally, the side effects can become more pronounced at higher doses, but there is no specific ""minimum"" dose established that guarantees the absence of ED. It is important to discuss any concerns about side effects with your healthcare provider, who can help determine the best course of action, including potential dosage adjustments or alternative treatments.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) have been associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in some studies, although the exact duration of this association is not well-defined. The potential for NSAIDs to contribute to ED may stem from their effects on blood flow and prostaglandin synthesis, which are important for achieving and maintaining an erection. While some patients may experience ED after starting NSAIDs, the timeline can vary widely among individuals. If you have concerns about NSAIDs and their impact on erectile function, it would be advisable to discuss this with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and potential alternatives.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by a pathological constriction at the aortic valve, which restricts the outflow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. This can lead to various complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy, as the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed valve. 

Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and heart murmurs, which are abnormal sounds caused by turbulent blood flow through the heart. The condition can be diagnosed through physical examination and imaging techniques, such as echocardiography.

Management of aortic stenosis often involves monitoring the condition, and in severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, such as valve replacement. It's important to discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider to understand the best course of action for your health.","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"Leukocytosis, or an increase in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the body, can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:

1. **Infection**: The body often responds to infections, whether bacterial, viral, or parasitic, by increasing white blood cell production to help fight off the invading microorganisms.

2. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases or tissue injury, can also lead to leukocytosis as part of the body's inflammatory response.

3. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger an increase in white blood cell counts as part of the body's stress response.

4. **Hypersensitivity Reactions**: Allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to certain antigens can result in elevated white blood cell counts.

5. **Other Medical Conditions**: Certain diseases, such as malignancies or bone marrow disorders, can also lead to leukocytosis.

If you have specific symptoms or concerns, it would be best to discuss them further for a more tailored evaluation.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
					Chronic myelogenous leukemia
					Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine
					Infections, bacterial or viral
					Myelofibrosis
					Polycythemia vera
					Rheumatoid arthritis
					Smoking
					Stress, such as severe emotional or physical stress
					Tuberculosis
