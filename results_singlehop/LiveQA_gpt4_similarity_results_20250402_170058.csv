Noonan syndrome. What are the references with noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease. ,"Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney disease are both hereditary conditions, but they are distinct disorders with different genetic causes and clinical features. 

1. **Noonan Syndrome**: This is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by features such as short stature, webbed neck, ptosis, skeletal malformations, and various cardiac abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in several genes, with PTPN11 being the most common. Noonan syndrome can occur in both males and females and is not linked to a specific karyotype abnormality.

2. **Polycystic Kidney Diseases (PKD)**: These are hereditary diseases characterized by the progressive formation of numerous cysts in the kidneys. PKD can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. The condition leads to kidney enlargement and can result in kidney failure over time.

**References between Noonan Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Disease**:
- **Inheritance**: Both conditions can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. For example, Noonan syndrome has been associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, as noted in the relations of the ""Autosomal dominant inheritance"" category.
- **Renal Abnormalities**: While Noonan syndrome itself does not primarily focus on renal issues, it can have overlapping features with other syndromes that may include renal abnormalities. Polycystic kidney disease is specifically characterized by renal cysts and dysfunction.

In summary, while Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney disease are separate entities, they share a commonality in being hereditary conditions and can both involve renal abnormalities in broader syndromic contexts. If you have specific concerns about the relationship between these two conditions in a patient, further genetic counseling and evaluation may be warranted.","Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.
					10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment.
					Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal
					ectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly."

vdrl positive.  vdrl positive patients please tell me what are he doing . Diagnosis and precaution.,"As a physician, it's important to address your VDRL positive result with appropriate steps for diagnosis and precaution.

1. **Diagnosis**: A positive VDRL test indicates the presence of antibodies that may suggest syphilis or other conditions. It is essential to confirm the diagnosis with more specific tests, such as the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) or the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. These tests will help determine if you have an active syphilis infection.

2. **Precaution**: If you are diagnosed with syphilis, it is crucial to take precautions to prevent transmission to others. This includes:
   - Informing sexual partners so they can also get tested and treated if necessary.
   - Avoiding sexual contact until you have completed treatment and received confirmation that the infection has been cleared.
   - Following up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment, which may include antibiotics such as penicillin.

Please ensure you schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your results and any necessary treatment options.","Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages."

"ANESTHESIA EFFECT ON FXTAS PERSONS..  Does Anesthesia given during a operation severely hurt, or damage a brain for FXTAS patient? The operation would be for hip replacement! Thank you very much","The effects of anesthesia on patients with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) can vary based on individual health conditions and the specific type of anesthesia used. Generally, anesthesia is administered to ensure that patients do not experience pain during surgical procedures, such as hip replacement. 

However, patients with FXTAS may have pre-existing neurological conditions, including intention tremor, ataxia, and cognitive disabilities, which could potentially influence how they respond to anesthesia. It is crucial for the surgical team to be aware of the patient's FXTAS diagnosis and any associated symptoms, as this may affect the choice of anesthetic agents and the management of anesthesia during the procedure.

Before the surgery, a thorough pre-operative evaluation should be conducted, discussing the surgical risks and any specific concerns related to FXTAS with the patient. This evaluation will help ensure that the anesthesia plan is tailored to minimize risks and address any potential complications.

In summary, while anesthesia is necessary for a hip replacement surgery, it is essential to consider the unique aspects of FXTAS in the anesthesia management plan to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes. Always consult with the surgical and anesthesia team regarding any specific concerns related to FXTAS and anesthesia.","Likewise, we don't know whether other developmental processes, or environmental factors, affect the expression of FXTAS. For example, although it hasn't been rigorously studied, investigators at UC Davis are interested in the possibility that surgery under a general anesthetic may
					affect the progression of FXTAS.. Typically patients with FXTAS do not tolerate surgery with general anesthesia well and further deterioration in both motor and cognitive abilities is typically seen (Jacquemont et al 2004). Therefore, surgery should be avoided if at all possible."
"DVT.  Can a birth control called Ocella cause DVT? My daughter experiences pains cramping,redness and swelling in her thigh and also really bad huge blood clots during her menstrual cycles after she was prescribed Osella for birth control. Also these syntoms worsened after she gave birth.
				This has been happening for a year now should she see discuss this with her doctor right away?","Yes, Ocella, like other hormonal birth control methods, can increase the risk of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms your daughter is experiencing—pain, cramping, redness, and swelling in her thigh, along with large blood clots during her menstrual cycles—are concerning and could be indicative of DVT or other complications. Given that these symptoms have worsened after childbirth, it is crucial for her to discuss this with her doctor as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is important to assess her condition and determine the appropriate course of action.","Some studies show that women who take oral contraceptives that contain drosperinone (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Safyral, Syeda, Yasmin, Yaz, and Zarah) may be more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (a serious or life-threatening condition in which blood clots that form in the
					veins, usually in the legs and may move through the body to the lungs) than women who take oral contraceptives that do not contain drosperinone. However, other studies do not show this increased risk. Before you begin taking oral contraceptives, talk to your doctor about the risk that you will
					develop blood clots and about which oral contraceptive or other method of birth control may be the best choice for you.Oral contraceptives may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."
"medication question. I have had a bad UTI for 3 months I have taken cipro 7 times uti returns days after I oomplete I need a new prescription but the doctors here can figure out what to give me as I am allergic to penicillin and allergic to dairy products wich is a filler in many drugs. Please please give me
				some idea of what I can get my dr; to prescribe","Given your history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and your allergies to penicillin and dairy products, it's important to consider alternative antibiotics that are effective against UTIs and do not contain these allergens.

1. **Nitrofurantoin**: This is often used for uncomplicated UTIs and is generally well-tolerated. However, it should be avoided in patients with significant renal impairment.

2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)**: This is another common option for UTIs, but it’s important to check for any potential allergies to sulfa drugs.

3. **Fosfomycin**: This is a single-dose treatment option that can be effective for uncomplicated UTIs and is less likely to cause resistance.

4. **Cefdinir or Cefpodoxime**: These are cephalosporins that may be suitable alternatives, but you should confirm with your doctor that you do not have a cross-reactivity allergy to these medications.

5. **Ciprofloxacin alternatives**: If you have been on ciprofloxacin multiple times and it hasn't resolved your infections, it may be worth discussing other fluoroquinolones with your doctor, but be cautious due to potential resistance.

Make sure to discuss these options with your physician, who can consider your specific medical history and any potential drug interactions. Additionally, it may be beneficial to perform a urine culture and sensitivity test to identify the specific bacteria causing your UTI and determine the most effective antibiotic treatment.","Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

infection. can a streptococcus infection cause an invasive disease like wegeners or the symptoms of wegeners?,"Streptococcal infections primarily involve bacteria of the genus Streptococcus and can lead to various health issues, but they are not directly associated with causing granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multisystemic disease characterized by inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and is typically linked to autoimmune processes rather than bacterial infections.

However, it is important to note that while streptococcal infections can lead to complications such as rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which may have some overlapping symptoms with autoimmune conditions, they do not cause granulomatous inflammation or the specific symptoms associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. If you are experiencing symptoms that concern you, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and appropriate management.","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness,
					and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - GPA - is serious but treatable. * The cause of GPA is unknown.

					granulomatosis will be provided with emphasis on the potential role of acute infections as a trigger for Wegener's granulomatosis and the head and neck manifestations.. Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).. The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

"Diabetes and pain control. 
				How can I narrow my search to find information regarding pain(joint) medication suitable to use with a person who has diabetes type 2.","To narrow your search for information regarding pain (joint) medication suitable for a person with Type 2 diabetes, consider the following steps:

1. **Focus on Analgesics**: Look for analgesics that are known to be safe for individuals with diabetes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are commonly used pain relievers that may be appropriate, but always check for any contraindications.

2. **Consider Drug Interactions**: Investigate potential drug interactions between pain medications and any diabetes medications the patient may be taking. This is crucial to avoid adverse effects and ensure effective pain management.

3. **Consult Pain Management Guidelines**: Review guidelines specific to pain management in patients with diabetes. These guidelines often provide recommendations on medication choices that consider the unique needs of diabetic patients.

4. **Evaluate the Level of Joint Pain**: Assess the severity of the joint pain to determine the appropriate level of medication needed. This can help in selecting the right type and dosage of analgesics.

5. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Consider involving a pain management specialist or a pharmacist who can provide insights into safe medication options and help coordinate care.

6. **Monitor Blood Sugar Levels**: Ensure that any pain management strategy includes monitoring the patient's blood sugar levels, as some pain medications can affect glucose metabolism.

By focusing on these areas, you can find suitable pain management options that align with the needs of a patient with Type 2 diabetes.","Diabetes and Sick Days: What Meds are OK
					Pain and fever reducers
					Examples: Tylenol, Aspirin
					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Use cautiously if you have renal disease.
					Anti-inflammatory

					Effect on diabetes: No effect. Also should be used carefully if you have renal disease."
"Macular Degeneration. I am a non-smoker , retired military veteran who was subjected to working conditions where the majority of fellow workers were smokers. Could or does second hand smoke contribute or is a cause for getting Early AMD. I was diagnosed with early AMD in 1982 when ventilation of work spaces
				was nearly non existent. My genetic profile does not include any previous conditions except that I am Caucasian.","Physician: Thank you for sharing your history. While smoking is a well-known risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the impact of secondhand smoke is less clear. However, studies suggest that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke may increase the risk of developing AMD, particularly in individuals who are already at risk due to age or genetic factors. 

Given that you were exposed to secondhand smoke in a poorly ventilated work environment, it is possible that this exposure could have contributed to your early diagnosis of AMD. Additionally, being Caucasian is another factor, as certain populations may have a higher predisposition to AMD. 

It's important to continue monitoring your eye health and discuss any changes in your vision with your eye care provider. They can provide guidance on managing your condition and any potential lifestyle changes that may help.","Smoking increases a person's chances of developing AMD by two to five fold. Because the retina has a high rate of oxygen consumption, anything that affects oxygen delivery to the retina may affect vision. Smoking causes oxidative damage, which may contribute to the development and
					progression of this disease.
					Learn more about why smoking damages the retina, and explore a number of steps you can take to protect your vision.. AIM:
					To undertake a systematic review of the literature on the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and eye disease.
					RESULTS:
					Seven studies evaluated the possible relationship between ETS and an eye disease. These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease."
"molar pregnancy.. is conception a requirement of a molar pregnancy. if so, when ?","Yes, conception is a requirement for a molar pregnancy. A molar pregnancy, also known as hydatidiform mole, occurs after the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon, leading to the formation of a zygote. However, in the case of a molar pregnancy, the fertilization process results in abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue rather than a viable embryo. This abnormality can manifest as either a complete or partial hydatidiform mole, characterized by the swelling of the chorionic villi and elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Therefore, conception is the initial step that leads to the development of a molar pregnancy, but it does not result in a normal gestation.","Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.. A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.. An ultrasound of a complete molar pregnancy - which can be detected as early as eight or nine weeks of pregnancy - may show:

					No embryo or fetus
					No amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta nearly filling the uterus
					Ovarian cysts
					An ultrasound of a partial molar pregnancy may show:

					A growth-restricted fetus
					Low amniotic fluid
					A thick cystic placenta"
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and
				feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Physician: It's understandable to consider that your symptoms could be related to arthritis, especially since swelling, soreness, and stiffness are common manifestations of that condition. However, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) can also cause similar symptoms, particularly if there is a history of nerve compression or issues with nerve function. 

In HNPP, patients often experience symptoms like weakness, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet, which can sometimes be mistaken for arthritis-related pain. The swelling you describe could be due to nerve issues rather than joint inflammation. 

It's important to differentiate between the two conditions, as the management and treatment strategies would differ significantly. If HNPP is confirmed, it may explain the ongoing issues with your hands. I recommend discussing your symptoms in detail with your healthcare provider, who can help clarify the diagnosis and guide you on the best course of action.","Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to
					several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.. The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so
					symptoms may come and go, or persist over time.. Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies
					and general peripheral neuropathies, including the hereditary neuropathies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome (see CMT Overview)."
"vasculitis. 
				Yes my wife has been dianosed with giant cell vasculitis
				Our doctors are not clear about this so im asking for help
				From you . She has vomited something like coffee grounds and swelling in her feet and legs is really bad.migranes and face swelling to.no blood clots but nothing to go on so please help if u can thank u [NAME]
				[CONTACT]","It sounds like your wife is experiencing several concerning symptoms related to her diagnosis of giant cell vasculitis. The coffee ground vomiting you mentioned is indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur due to various reasons, including the effects of vasculitis on blood vessels. The swelling in her feet and legs, known as peripheral edema, could be related to fluid retention or other complications associated with her condition. Additionally, the migraines and facial swelling may be linked to the underlying vasculitis affecting her blood flow and inflammation levels.

Given the complexity of her symptoms, it is crucial for her to be closely monitored by her healthcare team. They may need to conduct further evaluations, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to determine the cause of her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. Please ensure that she communicates all her symptoms to her doctors, as this information is vital for her care. If her symptoms worsen or if she experiences severe pain, difficulty breathing, or other alarming signs, seek immediate medical attention.","Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.. GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

					Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis."
can't find an answer. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with chronic pain along with some other things and my blood work showed that I was missing a chromosone. How would I find out if I have a genetic for of Fibromyalgia?,"To determine if you have a genetic form of fibromyalgia, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Genetic Testing**: Consult with a genetic counselor or a specialist who can guide you through the process of genetic testing. They can analyze your DNA for any genetic alterations that may be associated with fibromyalgia or other related conditions.

2. **Family History**: Discuss your family medical history with your healthcare provider. If fibromyalgia or similar conditions are present in your family, it may suggest a genetic component.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a rheumatologist or a specialist in chronic pain can help assess your symptoms and any potential genetic links. They may also consider other conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.

4. **Research Studies**: Look for clinical trials or research studies focusing on the genetic aspects of fibromyalgia. Participating in such studies may provide insights into the genetic factors associated with your condition.

5. **Follow-Up on Chromosome Aberrations**: Since your blood work indicated a missing chromosome, it’s important to follow up on this finding with a geneticist. They can help determine if this chromosomal abnormality is related to your fibromyalgia and chronic pain.

By taking these steps, you can gain a better understanding of whether there is a genetic basis for your fibromyalgia and how it may relate to your overall health.","Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.. Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic
					predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic
					factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.. That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"It's important to discuss any changes to your hormone replacement therapy, including stopping the estradiol patch, with your healthcare provider. Since you've been using the patch for 4.5 months, your physician will consider factors such as your symptoms, the reason for starting the therapy, and any potential withdrawal effects. They may recommend a gradual tapering off rather than an abrupt stop to minimize any adverse effects. Please schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns and options.","Climara (Estradiol Transdermal System) Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2 ) Climara systems are available. For the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment should be initiated with the 6.5 cm2 (0.025 mg/day) Climara system

"Ear Wax.. 
				I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Using hydrogen peroxide in the ear can help to soften earwax and facilitate its removal. However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Concentration**: Ensure that you are using a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide (typically around 3% is safe for use in the ear). Higher concentrations can be irritating and may cause damage to the ear canal.

2. **Ear Health**: If you have any existing ear conditions, such as a perforated eardrum, otitis externa, or any other ear infections, using hydrogen peroxide may exacerbate the issue. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional before using it in such cases.

3. **Technique**: When using hydrogen peroxide, make sure to follow proper techniques for ear irrigation. After allowing it to bubble for a few minutes, gently flush the ear with warm water. Avoid using excessive force, as this can cause discomfort or damage.

4. **Frequency**: Regular use of hydrogen peroxide for earwax removal should be approached with caution. Overuse can lead to irritation or dryness of the ear canal.

If you experience any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms after using hydrogen peroxide, it is advisable to stop and consult a healthcare provider. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and ensure that your ear health is maintained.","To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.
					Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the
					removal of wax.
					Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most
					effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment."
"Sevoflurane. 
				I work in a hospital, and a question recently came up regarding the stability of Sevoflurane once it has been opened. Does Sevoflurane expire within a particular timeframe or is the product still effective until the expiration date listed on the bottle?","The stability of Sevoflurane after it has been opened can vary based on several factors, including storage conditions and exposure to air. Generally, once a medical product like Sevoflurane is opened, it may have a reduced shelf life compared to its unopened state. 

It is important to refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific information regarding the stability and expiration of Sevoflurane after opening. The expiration date listed on the bottle typically applies to unopened products. After opening, the product may still be effective for a certain period, but it is crucial to ensure that it is stored properly and used within the recommended timeframe to maintain its efficacy and safety. 

If you have any specific protocols or guidelines from your hospital or the manufacturer, it would be best to follow those.","We prepared a 20% sevoflurane lipid emulsion using caprylic triglyceride (i.e., medium-chain triglyceride). In rats, this emulsion was an effective anesthetic and was not associated with adverse events. The emulsion was stable after consecutive evaluation for 365 days and for 180
					minutes after the vial was opened.. Sevoflurane is stable when stored under normal room lighting conditions. No discernible degradation of sevoflurane occurs in the presence of strong acids or heat. Sevoflurane is not corrosive to stainless steel, brass, aluminum nickel-plated brass, chrome-plated brass or copper beryllium

"ODD. 
				Would like to learn more about condition on ODD","Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral condition that typically develops in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedient, negative, and agitated behaviors, often directed towards authority figures. Unlike Conduct Disorder, individuals with ODD do not typically engage in aggressive behaviors, destruction, theft, or deceit. Instead, the symptoms may include a quarrelsome attitude and a tendency to be vengeful.

ODD can co-occur with other disorders, such as Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It's important to recognize that these behaviors can lead to significant impairment in social, academic, or other important areas of functioning.

If you have specific questions about the symptoms, causes, or treatment options for ODD, feel free to ask!","Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. . Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome. I would like to request further knowledge on this specific disorder.,"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical abnormalities and an increased risk of certain cancers. The primary features of BWS include:

1. **Umbilical Hernia**: A condition where part of the intestine protrudes through the abdominal wall at the umbilical area.
2. **Macroglossia**: An enlarged tongue, which can lead to difficulties with feeding and speech.
3. **Gigantism**: This refers to excessive growth, particularly during childhood, which can result in larger-than-average body size.

In addition to these primary features, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome may also experience secondary conditions such as:

- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of internal organs.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar levels, which can be particularly concerning in infants.
- **Ear Abnormalities**: These can include structural differences in the ears.

BWS is classified as a hereditary disorder of the endocrine system and is associated with imprinting disorders, which involve the silencing of one parental gene allele. This genetic aspect is crucial in understanding the syndrome's etiology.

The syndrome is also categorized under overgrowth syndromes, which are characterized by excessive growth and may lead to malignancies. 

If you have specific questions about diagnosis, management, or the implications of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, feel free to ask!","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal."
"CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.. 
				CITROBACTOR FREUNDII.
				Does ciprofaxin work well? Is there a better drug if so what.","Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that can be effective against various bacterial infections, including those caused by Citrobacter freundii. However, antibiotic resistance is a significant concern, and some strains of Citrobacter may exhibit resistance to ciprofloxacin. 

If ciprofloxacin is not effective due to resistance or if the patient has specific contraindications, alternative treatment options may include other antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or meropenem, depending on the susceptibility profile of the bacteria. It's essential to perform susceptibility testing to determine the most effective antibiotic for the specific strain of Citrobacter freundii in this case. 

Infection control management and appropriate antibiotic stewardship are also crucial in managing infections effectively and minimizing the risk of resistance.","There are no comparative studies of antibiotic therapy for Citrobacter infections. Thus, treatment of Citrobacter infections follows the principles for treatment of other Enterobacteriaceae infections. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities described above,
					aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and the fourth-generation cephems, such as cefepime and cefpirome, would appear to be preferred therapeutic agents for C. freundii infections.. Citrobacter species are a common cause of nosocomial infections associated with patients that are undergoing prolonged hospital treatments. C. freundii has recently been reported to express resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotincs including piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam,
					vancomycin and cephalosporins. Isolation of ceftriaxone-resistant Citrobacter freundii (CRCF) has been associated with the overprescribed broad spectrum antibiotics.. The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins."
"general health.  Hi I have a toddler 22 months and he was long exposure to car seat when he was infant and developed a flat head by then that was resolved, but since then he seems like his back is not well, he only sleep on his tummy, he hates to lay down on his back , he has a bad sitting position when
				on his car seat and other thing, I was wondering if he may need an evaluation to avoid further damage to his back, please let me know what kinf of doctor should I see, cause his pedi. Dr. Does not has any concerns about it. Thanks.","It sounds like your toddler may benefit from an evaluation by a specialist who can assess his posture and any potential musculoskeletal issues. Given the history of flat head (plagiocephaly) and the concerns about his sitting position and sleeping habits, I recommend seeing a pediatric physical therapist or a pediatric orthopedic specialist. 

A pediatric physical therapist can evaluate his posture, muscle tone, and movement patterns, and provide exercises or strategies to improve his sitting position and overall body mechanics. An orthopedic specialist can assess for any structural issues related to his spine or hips that may be contributing to his discomfort or unusual positioning.

If you have concerns about his development or if he is experiencing any delays in milestones, it may also be helpful to discuss these with the specialist. They can provide guidance on any necessary interventions or therapies to support his development.","The history and physical exam will help determine the severity and acuity of the patient's back pain. If there are no red flag issues, send the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist who provides care for children and follow up with the patient in clinic. If the history and
					physical uncover red flag issues, request appropriate radiographs and lab tests. See Page 2 for a guide to imaging studies. If screening radiographs point to a serious orthopedic condition, request an MRI or refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist who will get the necessary MRI."
"Ear Ache. 
				My son was treated for otitis media on [DATE]. Pains started the previous night. He is taking amoxicillin and antipyrine-benzocaine 5.5%-1.5% ear drops. This morning he woke up with a bit of blood drainage. Is that normal?","It's not uncommon for some drainage to occur with otitis media, especially if there is a rupture of the eardrum or if there is fluid accumulation that is being expelled. However, the presence of blood in the drainage can be concerning. It could indicate a more serious issue, such as a perforation of the eardrum or an infection that may require further evaluation. Since your son is already on amoxicillin and using antipyrine-benzocaine ear drops, it's important to monitor his symptoms closely. If the blood drainage continues, increases, or if he experiences worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, I recommend bringing him in for a follow-up examination as soon as possible.","With a severe ear infection, pressure may build up and cause the eardrum to rupture. Pus and blood may drain out. This usually relieves pain and pressure, and in most cases the eardrum heals on its own.. Middle ear infections may cause pain, hearing loss, and spontaneous rupture of the eardrum, resulting in a perforation. In this case,there may be infected or bloody drainage from the ear. Infections can cause a hole in the eardrum as a side effect of otitis media."
reaction to these 2 drugs. I would like to know if there are any drug reaction between Carvedilol 25 mg to Hydrslazine50 mg,"The physician should be aware that both carvedilol and hydralazine are antihypertensive agents, and their combined use may lead to an additive effect on blood pressure reduction. This could potentially result in hypotension (low blood pressure), especially in patients who are sensitive to blood pressure changes. 

Additionally, both medications have contraindications related to hypersensitivity, so the physician should ensure that the patient does not have a history of allergic reactions to either drug. 

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of excessive blood pressure lowering or adverse reactions when these two medications are used together. If the patient experiences symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting, the physician may need to adjust the dosages or consider alternative treatments. 

In summary, while there is no direct drug interaction noted between carvedilol and hydralazine, their combined effects on blood pressure should be carefully managed.","In addition, carvedilol produced a slight but significant inhibition of the pressor responses to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), which was nearly identical in magnitude to that seen with hydralazine.. Interaction between Coreg and Hydralazine: There is no known interaction between Coreg and Hydralazine in our records. However, an interaction may still exist. Always consult your doctor before taking these medications together. Do not stop taking the medications without a physician's advice."
"mixing medications. Hello, I would like to know if taking Dicyclomine 20mg, phentermine can have a adverse effect?","When considering the combination of Dicyclomine and Phentermine, it's important to note that both medications have contraindications related to glaucoma. Dicyclomine is a muscarinic antagonist that can potentially increase intraocular pressure, which is a concern for patients with glaucoma. Similarly, Phentermine is also contraindicated in patients with glaucoma due to its sympathomimetic effects.

Additionally, both medications can have anticholinergic side effects, which may lead to complications, especially in sensitive populations. Therefore, mixing these medications could pose risks, particularly for individuals with pre-existing conditions like glaucoma or those who may be sensitive to anticholinergic effects.

It is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before combining these medications to assess the potential risks and benefits based on your specific health situation.","There is no drug interactions reported by people who take Phentermine hydrochloride and Dicyclomine hydrochloride together yet. This review analyzes the effectiveness and drug interactions between Phentermine hydrochloride and Dicyclomine hydrochloride. It is created by eHealthMe based

Dementia.  Is dementia genetically passed down or could anyone get it,"Dementia can have both genetic and non-genetic factors. While certain types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, can have hereditary components, meaning they may run in families, not everyone with a family history will develop dementia. Additionally, there are many other risk factors, including lifestyle and environmental influences, that can contribute to the development of dementia. Therefore, while genetics can play a role, it is not the sole determinant, and anyone can potentially develop dementia regardless of their genetic background.","Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).. The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease
					are not inherited."
"sleep apnea.  Is there a ""sleep apnea surgery"". I've heard that there is , but have never found a doctor that does this. My husband has been on C-pap for two years but has not been able to keep it on for more then 2 hours. He is not overweight, has had a stroke at 40 years old and double by-pass at
				50 years old. Otherwise he follows doctors orders and has no other problems. Thank you for your time, [NAME]","Yes, there are surgical options available for treating sleep apnea, particularly for obstructive sleep apnea. One common procedure is called palatopharyngoplasty, which involves surgery on the throat to remove excess tissue and widen the airway. This can help alleviate the obstruction that causes apneas during sleep.

Given your husband's history, including his stroke and heart surgery, it's essential to consult with a specialist who can evaluate his specific situation and determine the most appropriate treatment options. A sleep specialist or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor would be a good starting point. They can assess whether surgery is a viable option for him, considering his medical history and current health status. 

If he has difficulty using the CPAP machine, it’s also worth discussing alternative treatments or devices that may be more comfortable for him. Thank you for reaching out, and I hope your husband finds relief soon.","Surgery is an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with snoring and sleep apnea, particularly those who are unable to use or tolerate CPAP.

Diahrrea . I take Loperamide for chronic diahrrea. Then I stop it for about 2 days so I can have a bowel movement. But then the stool is really soft and there were a few times I almost didn't make to the bathroom. Is there a way for a happy medium,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge when managing chronic diarrhea with loperamide. While loperamide can help reduce diarrhea by decreasing gastrointestinal motility, it can also lead to constipation if used continuously. To find a happy medium, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adjust Dosage**: You might need to adjust the dosage of loperamide. Instead of stopping it completely, try a lower dose that still helps manage your symptoms without causing constipation.

2. **Dietary Changes**: Incorporate foods that can help firm up your stool, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet). Avoid high-fiber foods and dairy products, which can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea.

3. **Hydration**: Ensure you stay well-hydrated, especially if you're experiencing loose stools. Electrolyte solutions can be beneficial.

4. **Scheduled Bowel Movements**: Try to establish a regular schedule for bowel movements. This can help train your body and may reduce the urgency you feel.

5. **Consult a Specialist**: If you continue to have difficulty finding a balance, it may be helpful to consult a gastroenterologist. They can provide tailored advice and may suggest alternative treatments or therapies.

6. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep track of your symptoms, including stool consistency and frequency, to help identify patterns and triggers.

By working closely with your healthcare provider, you can find a management plan that minimizes both diarrhea and the discomfort of constipation.","IMODIUM - loperamide hydrochloride capsule
					Chronic Diarrhea
					Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may
					then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
					The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further
					administration. IMODIUM administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.. A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered."
"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Yes, uveitis can be associated with autoimmune diseases. It is classified as an inflammatory disorder of the eye, and autoimmune diseases are characterized by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues, which can lead to inflammation, including in the uvea of the eye. Therefore, while not all cases of uveitis are due to autoimmune diseases, there is a significant relationship between the two.","Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue
					by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis.

Amlodipine. I am taking Amlodipine and it has caused my pause rate to be very high. Is there a weaning process when you stop taking Amlodipine and start atenolol? I am taking 5 mg of amlodipine and will be taking 50 mg of atenolol?,"When transitioning from amlodipine to atenolol, it's important to consider the weaning process carefully. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can lower blood pressure, while atenolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist that also has blood pressure-lowering effects. 

Since both medications can cause decreased blood pressure, it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure closely during the transition. Generally, there may not be a formal ""weaning"" process for amlodipine, but your physician may recommend gradually reducing the dose or stopping it while starting atenolol to avoid any sudden changes in blood pressure.

It's essential to follow your physician's guidance on how to make this switch safely, as they will tailor the process based on your specific health needs and response to the medications. Always communicate any side effects or concerns you experience during this transition.","Abrupt cessation may precipitate angina, MI, arrhythmias, or rebound HTN; discontinue by tapering over 1-2 weeks.

very worry and need advise .. dear sir i had car accident 2 months a go . other person blood splash one me and i saw a lot of blood on my hand and some on face . not sure about eye . i didn't wash it immediatly and until 15 minute later then i washed it . am i risk hiv ? thank you .,"Dear Patient,

Thank you for reaching out with your concerns. Based on the information you've provided, it is understandable to feel worried after such an incident. 

Exposure to blood can potentially pose a risk for HIV transmission, especially if the blood comes from a person who is HIV positive. However, the risk of HIV transmission through blood exposure in a situation like a car accident is generally considered to be low, particularly if there were no open wounds or mucous membrane exposure (like cuts or abrasions on your skin or in your eyes).

Since you mentioned that you washed the blood off your hands and face after about 15 minutes, this action can significantly reduce the risk of infection. It is important to note that HIV does not survive long outside the human body, and the risk of transmission decreases with time and proper washing.

To ensure your safety and peace of mind, I recommend that you consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation. They may suggest testing for HIV and other blood-borne pathogens, as well as discussing the possibility of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if deemed necessary. PEP is most effective when started within 72 hours of potential exposure.

Please take care and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

Best regards.","You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.. Non-sexual Transmission
					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick."
Swan NDC 0869-0871-43. I found 4 cases of expired (04/2010) Hydrogen Peroxide. How do I safely dispose of this product?,"To safely dispose of expired hydrogen peroxide, you should follow these steps:

1. **Check Local Regulations**: Before disposal, check your local regulations regarding hazardous waste. Hydrogen peroxide can be considered hazardous waste, so it's important to follow local guidelines.

2. **Dilution**: If allowed by local regulations, you can dilute the hydrogen peroxide with water. This reduces its concentration and makes it safer for disposal.

3. **Disposal**: After dilution, you can pour the solution down the drain with plenty of water, provided that your local wastewater treatment facility can handle it. Alternatively, you can take it to a hazardous waste disposal facility.

4. **Do Not Mix**: Never mix hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals, especially those that are acidic or alkaline, as this can create dangerous reactions.

5. **Container**: Ensure that the hydrogen peroxide is in a secure, labeled container during disposal to prevent leaks or spills.

If you are unsure about any of these steps, it is best to contact your local waste management authority for specific instructions on disposing of hazardous materials like hydrogen peroxide.",Hydrogen peroxide solutions can be disposed of with no special treatment. You can safely pour them down the drain of a sink or into a toilet.
congenital diaphragmatic hernia..  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. what are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Can cousin marriage cause this? What kind of lung disease the baby might experience life long?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is primarily caused by embryologic defects in the diaphragm, which can lead to the protrusion of abdominal structures into the thorax. The exact etiology of CDH is not fully understood, but it can be associated with various factors, including genetic predispositions and environmental influences. While cousin marriage can increase the risk of congenital abnormalities due to shared genetic material, it is not a direct cause of CDH. 

Babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia may experience several lung-related complications, primarily due to associated pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs) and pulmonary hypertension. These conditions can lead to long-term respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease, reduced lung function, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The severity of these lung diseases can vary based on the extent of the hernia and the degree of lung development at birth.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not
					known.[5]. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.

					When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.. The contents of your child's abdomen, including the stomach, intestines, liver and spleen may go through the hole and into his chest.
					This prevents the normal development of the lung on that side, and may also affect the growth of the other lung. And when your child's lungs don't fully develop, he will have trouble breathing after he is born. Complications of a CDH may include: Chronic lung disease: This serious condition can
					require your child to have oxygen or medications after being discharged from the hospital."
"shingles
			. need to know about the work place and someone having shingles, especially while handling food.","When it comes to handling food in a workplace setting, it's important to consider the implications of having someone with shingles (herpes zoster) present. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. While shingles itself is not directly transmitted through food, the virus can be spread through direct contact with the fluid from the blisters that appear on the skin.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Transmission Risk**: Shingles is contagious to individuals who have never had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against it. If someone with shingles has open sores, there is a risk of transmitting the virus through direct contact.

2. **Food Safety**: In a food handling environment, it is crucial to maintain strict hygiene practices. Anyone with shingles should avoid direct contact with food and food preparation areas, especially if they have visible lesions.

3. **Workplace Policies**: Many workplaces have policies regarding illness and food safety. It may be advisable for the person with shingles to take time off work until the blisters have crusted over, which typically indicates that they are no longer contagious.

4. **Preventive Measures**: Encourage good hand hygiene, use of gloves, and proper sanitation of surfaces to minimize any risk of contamination.

5. **Consultation**: It may be beneficial to consult with a healthcare professional or an occupational health specialist for specific guidance tailored to your workplace situation.

In summary, while shingles does not pose a direct risk through food, precautions should be taken to ensure the safety of all employees and customers in a food handling environment.","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.. A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would
					develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. A person is not infectious before
					blisters appear or if pain persists after the rash is gone (post-herpetic neuralgia). The risk of spreading shingles is low if the rash is covered. People with shingles should keep the rash covered, not touch or scratch the rash, and wash their hands often to prevent the spread of shingles.
					Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
			. My question to you is: what is the reason that there is very little attentions is to Antiphosoholipid Syndrome? To find the causes and possibly some type of cure for us who struggle with this auto-immune blood disorder? I guess that since it is female directed (9-1 female to male) that
				no one important enough has died from APS? Oh, by the way, I'm a 58 year old man!","Physician: Thank you for your question and for sharing your experience. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is indeed a significant autoimmune disorder that can lead to serious complications, including thrombosis and pregnancy-related issues. The relative lack of attention to APS in research and clinical settings may be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, APS is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, which can overshadow its specific symptoms and complications. This can lead to a focus on the more prevalent conditions rather than APS itself.

Secondly, while APS predominantly affects women, it is important to recognize that men can also be affected, as you are. The perception that it is a ""female-directed"" condition may contribute to a lack of awareness and urgency in research funding and clinical attention.

Lastly, the complexity of autoimmune diseases, including APS, makes it challenging to find targeted treatments. Research is ongoing, and there is a growing recognition of the need for more studies focused specifically on APS to better understand its mechanisms and develop effective therapies.

Your voice and experiences are crucial in raising awareness about APS, and I encourage you to continue advocating for more research and attention to this condition. If you have specific concerns or symptoms, please discuss them with your healthcare provider, who can help you manage your condition effectively.","Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, infection or certain medications, or you can develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.. Doctors generally use medications that reduce your blood's tendency to clot to help prevent complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have thrombosis, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications."

Simvastatin. Why is it recommended that this medicine be taken in the evening? Any harm in taking it in the morning?,"Simvastatin is recommended to be taken in the evening because cholesterol synthesis in the liver is typically higher at night. By taking simvastatin in the evening, you can maximize its effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. 

Taking simvastatin in the morning may not cause harm, but it could potentially reduce the medication's effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels. If you have any concerns or specific circumstances that might affect your medication schedule, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day.. Most manufacturers of statins recommend that they are taken at night, on the basis of physiological studies which show that most cholesterol is synthesised when dietary intake is at its lowest. Simvastatin is probably best taken at night because concentrations of total cholesterol and of
					low density lipoprotein are significantly greater when it is taken in the morning."

				long should we expect this drug to stay in his system. He is really experiencing chills/fever/abdominal pain..are these common when coming off this drug? Is there anything else we should expect?","Physician: It's important to understand that prednisone can have a range of effects on the body, especially when discontinuing it after long-term use. Since your husband has been on prednisone for almost a year, he may experience withdrawal symptoms as his body adjusts to the absence of the medication. Common symptoms of steroid withdrawal can include fatigue, body aches, fever, chills, and abdominal pain. 

The duration that prednisone stays in the system can vary, but generally, it has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours, meaning it can be cleared from the body within a few days. However, the physiological effects and withdrawal symptoms may last longer, especially after prolonged use.

It's crucial to monitor his symptoms closely. If the chills, fever, and abdominal pain persist or worsen, I recommend contacting his healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may want to assess whether these symptoms are related to withdrawal or if there is another underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, it may be beneficial to discuss a tapering schedule with his physician if he hasn't already, as this can help minimize withdrawal symptoms.","If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug. If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it.

This can occur due to various factors, including degenerative changes in the intervertebral disc and the vertebral end-plates, often associated with aging or structural damage.

These nodes are considered a type of herniation and are classified under orthopedic disorders of the spine.

Topic not covered. What exactly is sleep paralysis?,"Sleep paralysis is a common condition characterized by a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. During an episode, which typically lasts for a few seconds to a couple of minutes, individuals may experience partial or total paralysis of their skeletal muscles and may also have a sensation of areflexia (lack of reflexes). This condition can occur in otherwise healthy individuals or may be associated with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, cataplexy, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The episodes can sometimes be interrupted by external stimuli, such as touch or sound. The underlying mechanism of sleep paralysis is closely related to the normal muscle atonia that occurs during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is the stage of sleep associated with dreaming.","Sleep Paralysis

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics
			. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy',
				and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree
				climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","It's great to hear that you're looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, especially considering your history of being active. However, managing asthma while exercising can be challenging, and it's important to choose the right types of activities to minimize the risk of triggering symptoms like dyspnea (difficulty breathing).

Here are some exercise recommendations for individuals with asthma, particularly those who are overweight:

1. **Aerobic Exercises**: Low-impact aerobic activities can be beneficial. Consider options like walking, swimming, or cycling at a moderate pace. These activities can help improve cardiovascular fitness without putting too much strain on your respiratory system.

2. **Controlled Breathing Techniques**: Incorporating breathing exercises can help you manage your asthma symptoms. Techniques such as pursed-lip breathing or diaphragmatic breathing can improve your lung function and help you feel more in control during physical activity.

3. **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always start with a gentle warm-up to prepare your body for exercise and finish with a cool-down to help your body recover. This can help reduce the likelihood of asthma symptoms.

4. **Avoid Triggers**: Pay attention to environmental factors that may trigger your asthma, such as cold air, pollen, or pollution. On days when the weather is particularly challenging, consider indoor exercises.

5. **Consult with a Healthcare Provider**: Before starting any new exercise program, it's essential to consult with your physician or a respiratory therapist. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and help you develop a safe exercise plan.

6. **Gradual Progression**: Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as your body adapts. This approach can help you build endurance without overwhelming your respiratory system.

7. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to help keep your airways moist and reduce the risk of asthma symptoms.

Remember, it's important to listen to your body. If you experience any symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness, or increased shortness of breath, stop exercising and use your rescue inhaler if prescribed. With the right approach, you can find enjoyable and safe ways to stay active while managing your asthma.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey. Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

					The trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...
					One recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...
					One study found that people who practiced Hatha yoga two-and-a-half hours a week for 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. The same benefit would probably result from Tai Chi, a martial art that also emphasizes breathing, says Dr. Graham. ..."
hi. I can't find this I take Ambien every night for sleep. I want to no how long before I go to bed am I supposed to take it.,"Physician: It's generally recommended to take Ambien about 30 minutes before you plan to go to bed. This allows enough time for the medication to start working and help you fall asleep. However, it's important to follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage and timing. If you have any concerns or questions about your medication, feel free to ask!","If you are taking the tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets (Edluar), or oral spray, you will take the medication as needed, not more than one time a day, immediately before bedtime. You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take zolpidem and will remain sleepy
					for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take zolpidem tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets (Edluar), and oral spray and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours.. Administration Instructions
					Patients should be counseled to take AMBIEN right before they get into bed and only when they are able to stay in bed a full night (7-8 hours) before being active again. AMBIEN tablets should not be taken with or immediately after a meal. Advise patients NOT to take AMBIEN if they drank alcohol that

bundle blockage. could you please tell me what a bundle blockage is. what are the symptoms. what is usually done for this? Thank you,"Bundle branch block is a form of heart block where the electrical stimulation of the heart ventricles is interrupted at one of the branches of the Bundle of His. This interruption prevents the simultaneous depolarization of the two ventricles, which can affect the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently.

Symptoms of bundle branch block can vary. Some individuals may experience no symptoms at all, while others might have symptoms such as:

- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Chest pain or discomfort

In terms of management, the approach depends on the underlying cause and the presence of symptoms. If the bundle branch block is asymptomatic and not associated with other heart conditions, it may not require treatment. However, if symptoms are present or if it is associated with other cardiac issues, further evaluation may be necessary. This could include:

- Monitoring with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess heart rhythm and function.
- Medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.
- In some cases, a pacemaker may be recommended to help regulate the heart's electrical activity.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.","Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)"
general health. I have an infection in gums...dentist prescribed Cephalexin 500mg...Is this ok to take even though I am ALLERGIC TO PENICILLAN?,"Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which is structurally different from penicillin. While there is a possibility of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, many patients with a penicillin allergy can tolerate cephalosporins like cephalexin. However, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking cephalexin, especially given your allergy to penicillin. They can assess your specific situation and determine if cephalexin is safe for you.","Administration of cephalothin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, and cefazolin in penicillin-allergic patients is associated with a significant increase in the rate of allergic reactions; whereas administration of cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone is not."
Arrhthmia. can arrhythmia occurs after ablation? What is the success rate of Ablation? During my Holter test it was found that my Heart rate fluctuates from 254 to 21. How do you rate the situation?,"Physician: Yes, arrhythmias can occur after an ablation procedure, although the goal of ablation is to eliminate or reduce the frequency of these abnormal heart rhythms. The success rate of ablation varies depending on the type of arrhythmia being treated, but many studies suggest that it can be quite effective, often achieving success rates of 70-90% for certain types of arrhythmias.

Regarding your Holter monitor test results, a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21 is concerning. A heart rate of 254 indicates a very high rate (tachycardia), while 21 is extremely low (bradycardia). Such fluctuations can be indicative of significant underlying issues, and it's important to discuss these findings in detail. I recommend further evaluation to understand the cause of these fluctuations and to determine the best course of action for your treatment.","Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including:

					Bleeding or infection at the site where your catheter was inserted
					Damage to your blood vessels where the catheter may have scraped as it traveled to your heart
					Puncture of your heart
					Damage to your heart valves
					Damage to your heart's electrical system, which could worsen your arrhythmia and require a pacemaker to correct
					Blood clots in your legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism)
					Stroke or heart attack
					Narrowing of the veins that carry blood between your lungs and heart (pulmonary vein stenosis)
					Damage to your kidneys from dye used during the procedure
					Death in rare cases. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Destroying this tissue helps restore your heart's regular rhythm. The procedure is also called
					radiofrequency ablation. Catheter ablation is a low-risk procedure that is successful in most people who have it.. Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as ""left atrial
					flutter."" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.. Do you need treatment?

					Most arrhythmias are considered harmless and are left untreated. Once your doctor has documented that you have an arrhythmia, he or she will need to find out whether it's abnormal or merely reflects the heart's normal processes. He or she will also determine whether your arrhythmia is clinically
					significant - that is, whether it causes symptoms or puts you at risk for more serious arrhythmias or complications of arrhythmias in the future. If your arrhythmia is abnormal and clinically significant, your doctor will set a treatment plan."
"fildena. Hello I was wondering if fildena is truly like Viagra. I'm trying to find an alternative since my insurance no longer will cover Viagra for what ever reason. Would like to know all relavent information regarding fildena. About all I've found is that it is not fda approved so any
				information would be helpful thanks","Fildena is a medication that contains sildenafil, the same active ingredient found in Viagra. Both medications are phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, which work by increasing the availability of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the body, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and improved blood flow to the penis, thereby helping to achieve and maintain an erection.

However, it's important to note that while Fildena may have similar effects to Viagra, it is not FDA approved. This means that it has not undergone the same rigorous testing and evaluation for safety and efficacy as Viagra has. The lack of FDA approval can raise concerns about the quality, consistency, and safety of the medication.

If you're considering switching to Fildena or any other alternative, it's crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on the best options for your specific situation, including potential alternatives that are FDA approved and covered by your insurance. Additionally, they can help monitor your response to any new medication and ensure that it is safe for you to use.","Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications
					Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you
					to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.. Fildena contains Sildenafil Citrate, a common ingredient used in various leading branded ED pills like kamagra etc. and which are available over the counter. Sildenafil Citrate was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharma. Sildenafil
					Citrate helps treat erectile dysfunction (trouble having an erection). Helps a man have an erection or have a better erection with his penis during sex. It also treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in both men and women.

					Fildena is the latest ED pill launched by Fortune Healthcare which has more than two decade's experience in producing ED pills. Fildena has the same trust and guarantee of millions of worldwide patients who have earlier used other ED pills like Filagra, Filitra and Tadalista all manufactured by

ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Can Low dose naltrexone be used for treatment of severe depression?,"The use of low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of severe depression is an area of ongoing research. While naltrexone is primarily known as an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorder, some studies suggest it may have potential benefits in treating various mood disorders, including depression. 

However, it is important to note that clinical trials are necessary to establish the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosage of low-dose naltrexone for severe depression. You can search for specific clinical trials related to this treatment on ClinicalTrials.gov to find studies that are currently recruiting participants or have been completed. Always consult with a healthcare professional before considering new treatment options.","The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the
					treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose
					naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.. LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed."
general health. How do you catch hepatitis?,"Hepatitis can be transmitted through various means, depending on the type of hepatitis virus involved. Here are some common ways hepatitis can be caught:

1. **Hepatitis A**: This virus is typically spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, often due to poor sanitation or hygiene practices.

2. **Hepatitis B**: This virus is primarily transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, or vaginal secretions. Common modes of transmission include unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing needles, and from mother to child during childbirth.

3. **Hepatitis C**: Similar to Hepatitis B, it is mainly spread through blood-to-blood contact. This can occur through sharing needles, receiving contaminated blood products, or less commonly, through sexual contact.

4. **Hepatitis D**: This virus only occurs in those infected with Hepatitis B, as it requires the Hepatitis B virus to replicate. It is transmitted in similar ways to Hepatitis B.

5. **Hepatitis E**: This virus is usually transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water, similar to Hepatitis A.

To reduce the risk of catching hepatitis, it is important to practice good hygiene, ensure safe food and water consumption, and avoid sharing needles or engaging in unprotected sex. Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and B, which can provide effective protection against these types.","Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.. HEPATITIS A is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Ingestion of fecal matter, even in
					microscopic amounts, from:
					* Close person-to-person contact
					with an infected person
					* Sexual contact with an infected
					person
					* Ingestion of contaminated food
					or drinks

					HEPATITIS B is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with infectious blood, semen, and other body
					fluids primarily through:
					* Birth to an infected mother
					* Sexual contact with an infected person
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes, or other
					injection drug equipment
					* Needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries

					HEPATITIS C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
					Routes of Transmission
					Contact with blood of an infected person
					primarily through:
					* Sharing of contaminated needles, syringes,
					or other injection drug equipment

"Jock Itch. I have Jock itch, and I have read through your symptoms. I wanted know if small lumps under the skin around the scrotum area is a symptoms as well? Should I be concerned?","Physician: Jock itch, or tinea cruris, is a fungal infection that typically affects the groin area, including the skin around the scrotum. While small lumps under the skin around the scrotum can occur, they are not a common symptom of jock itch. These lumps could be due to various reasons, such as cysts, ingrown hairs, or other skin conditions. It's important to monitor any changes in the area. If the lumps are painful, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like redness, swelling, or discharge, I recommend scheduling an appointment for a thorough examination. It's always better to be cautious when it comes to changes in your skin.","Jock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:
					Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges.
					Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center.
					Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.. Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

general health. What are the causes of rib cage pain? And and the remedy,"Rib cage pain can be caused by several conditions, including:

1. **Tietze's Syndrome**: This is characterized by painful swellings of the costal cartilages, particularly the second rib, and can mimic the pain associated with coronary artery disease.

2. **Slipping Rib Syndrome**: This condition involves the displacement of the ribs and can lead to pain in the rib cage area.

3. **Costochondritis**: This is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the sternum, leading to localized pain.

4. **Pleurisy**: Inflammation of the pleura, the lining of the lungs, can cause sharp chest pain, especially when breathing deeply or coughing.

5. **Musculoskeletal Pain**: Discomfort stemming from muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bones can also manifest as rib cage pain.

6. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: This condition can cause referred pain in the chest area due to acid reflux irritating the esophagus.

**Remedies** may include:

- **Rest and Ice**: For conditions like Tietze's syndrome or costochondritis, resting the affected area and applying ice can help reduce inflammation and pain.
- **Pain Relief Medications**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can alleviate discomfort.
- **Physical Therapy**: Engaging in physical therapy may help strengthen the muscles around the rib cage and improve flexibility.
- **Avoiding Triggers**: For GERD, avoiding certain foods and eating smaller meals can help manage symptoms.
- **Consultation with a Healthcare Provider**: If the pain persists or worsens, it is important to seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. 

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.","Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
					Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
					Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (costochondritis)
					Osteoporosis
					Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
					Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a ribcage fracture.

					Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain."

Appendicitis can lead to an abnormal elevation of body temperature due to the inflammatory process, but some patients may not exhibit a fever. It's important to consider other symptoms and clinical findings when diagnosing appendicitis.","A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main
					symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include

While the extended-release (ER) version is typically taken once a day, the immediate-release form, like the 5 mg tablets you mentioned, is often prescribed to be taken multiple times a day. If your urologist has prescribed the 5 mg tablets to be taken twice a day, it is likely based on your individual condition and response to the medication. However, if you have any concerns or confusion about the dosage, it is always best to consult directly with your urologist for clarification.","Adults

Drug interactions. is it safe to take diclofenac when taking lisinopril or aleve or extra-strength Tylenol?,"When considering drug interactions, it's important to note the following:

1. **Diclofenac and Lisinopril**: There is a potential interaction between diclofenac (an NSAID) and lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor). NSAIDs can reduce the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and may increase the risk of kidney problems, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues or dehydration. Therefore, caution is advised when using these medications together.

2. **Diclofenac and Aleve (Naproxen)**: Both diclofenac and naproxen are NSAIDs. Taking them together can increase the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and kidney damage. It is generally not recommended to use two NSAIDs simultaneously.

3. **Diclofenac and Extra-Strength Tylenol (Acetaminophen)**: There is no direct interaction between diclofenac and acetaminophen. They can be used together, but it's important to monitor the total dosage of acetaminophen to avoid liver damage, especially if taken in high doses or for extended periods.

In summary, it is advisable to avoid taking diclofenac with lisinopril and naproxen. If you need to manage pain while on lisinopril, consider discussing the use of acetaminophen with your physician, ensuring you stay within safe dosage limits. Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.","Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

					Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL
					BLEEDING, ULCERATION, PERFORATION and DRUG INTERACTIONS). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in ""over the counter"" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.. Some foods and medicines may affect how lisinopril works. Tell your doctor if you are using any of the following:

					Aliskiren, everolimus, lithium, sirolimus, temsirolimus
					Another blood pressure medicine, including an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
					Diuretic (water pill, including amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene)
					Insulin or diabetes medicine
					NSAID pain or arthritis medicine (including aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen)"
"patau sydrome/ trisomy 13	. i was wondering the condition of trisomy progresses over time (gets worse as they become older) also, how to diognose the disorder thank you!","Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a genetic disorder that can lead to a variety of severe abnormalities. The progression of the condition can vary significantly among individuals. Generally, many infants with trisomy 13 face serious health challenges, and the prognosis is often poor. Many affected individuals may not survive past their first year of life due to complications associated with the syndrome. However, some may live longer, but they often experience worsening health issues over time, including developmental delays and physical disabilities.

As for diagnosing Patau syndrome, it typically involves a combination of physical examinations and genetic testing. Physicians may look for characteristic physical features associated with the syndrome, such as microcephaly, polydactyly, and other abnormalities. Genetic testing, such as karyotyping, can confirm the presence of an extra chromosome 13, which is definitive for diagnosing trisomy 13. If you have concerns about symptoms or diagnosis, it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance and support.","Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed
					eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within
					their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year.. Clinical tests (28 available)

"quinine in seltzer water.. quinine in seltzer water.
				Is it ok to drink quinine in seltzer water to ease leg cramps? If so, what would be the correct ""dosage""? It has a nasty taste but it does ease leg cramps. Thank you.","Yes, quinine can be used to help ease leg cramps, as it has been noted to have effects on muscle cramps. However, it's important to be cautious with the dosage. The typical dosage of quinine for leg cramps is not well established, and it is generally recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. 

Quinine is often available in various forms, including as a component in tonic water, which is similar to seltzer water but may contain added sugars and flavors. If you are considering using quinine in seltzer water, ensure that the concentration of quinine is appropriate and safe for consumption. 

Please consult your physician for specific dosage recommendations based on your health status and any other medications you may be taking, especially since quinine can have contraindications, such as with tinnitus.","Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

"Mite Infestation	. Please inform me of the recommended treatment and prevention protocol for mite infestation in humans, particularly one that is non-toxic or has minimal side effects.","For the treatment of mite infestation, particularly in cases like scabies or other forms of acariasis, the following non-toxic or low-side-effect options are generally recommended:

1. **Topical Treatments**: 
   - **Permethrin Cream**: A topical insecticide that is effective against mites. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects.
   - **Ivermectin**: While typically an oral medication, it can also be used topically in some cases. It is effective against various mite infestations.

2. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Tea Tree Oil**: Known for its antimicrobial properties, it may help in reducing mite populations on the skin.
   - **Neem Oil**: Another natural remedy that has been used for its insecticidal properties.

3. **Hygiene Practices**: 
   - Regular washing of bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water to eliminate mites.
   - Vacuuming carpets and upholstery frequently to remove any potential mite habitats.

4. **Avoidance of Irritants**: 
   - Use gentle, fragrance-free soaps and lotions to avoid further irritation of the skin.

**Prevention Protocol**:
- Maintain good personal hygiene and keep living areas clean.
- Avoid close contact with individuals known to have mite infestations.
- Regularly wash and dry bedding and clothing on high heat to kill any mites.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan, especially if you have sensitive skin or other health concerns.","When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.. Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No ""over-the-counter"" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.. Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications."

general health. What are the reasons for Hypoglycemia in newborns.. and what steps should a pregnent take to avoid this.,"Hypoglycemia in newborns can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Maternal Diabetes**: If the mother has diabetes, especially gestational diabetes, the newborn may experience hypoglycemia after birth due to high insulin levels.
2. **Prematurity**: Premature infants are at a higher risk for hypoglycemia because their liver may not be fully developed to produce glucose.
3. **Low Birth Weight**: Infants with low birth weight may have less glycogen stored in their liver, leading to a higher risk of hypoglycemia.
4. **Inadequate Feeding**: If the newborn is not feeding adequately, they may not receive enough glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels.
5. **Infections or Illness**: Newborns with infections or other health issues may have disrupted glucose metabolism, leading to hypoglycemia.

To help prevent hypoglycemia in newborns, pregnant women can take the following steps:

1. **Manage Blood Sugar Levels**: If the mother has diabetes, it is crucial to manage blood sugar levels effectively throughout the pregnancy.
2. **Regular Prenatal Care**: Attend all prenatal appointments to monitor the health of both the mother and the fetus.
3. **Healthy Diet**: Maintain a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support fetal growth and development.
4. **Monitor Fetal Movements**: Be aware of fetal movements and report any significant changes to a healthcare provider.
5. **Educate on Feeding**: After birth, ensure that the newborn is fed adequately and promptly, especially within the first few hours of life.

By following these steps, pregnant women can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in their newborns.","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth."
diverticulitis. can diverticulosis or diverticulitis be detected by a cat scan if there is no infection at that time?,"Yes, both diverticulitis and diverticulosis can be detected by a CT scan, even in the absence of an infection. A CT scan is a valuable diagnostic tool that can visualize the presence of diverticula (which indicates diverticulosis) and assess any inflammation or complications associated with diverticulitis. Therefore, it can provide important information about the condition of the intestines regardless of whether an infection is present.","CT scan: This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.. What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis."
"CAUSE OF A COLD	. i UNDERSTAND CONTAGION AND TRANSFERRENCE OF COLD ""GERMS"" WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFFECTED AND OTHERS NOT?","The reason some people are affected by colds while others are not can be attributed to several factors, including their immune response and disease susceptibility. 

1. **Immune Response**: Individuals with a strong immune response are better equipped to fend off infections, including the viruses that cause colds. This immune response involves various components that help recognize and eliminate pathogens.

2. **Disease Susceptibility**: Some people may have a constitution or condition that makes them more susceptible to infections. This can be due to genetic factors, existing health conditions, or lifestyle choices that affect their overall health and immune function.

In summary, while contagion plays a significant role in the transmission of cold viruses, the likelihood of becoming ill also depends on an individual's immune response and their susceptibility to disease.","Common cold
					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

SSPE. My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) typically occurs in children and young adults, usually 2-8 years after an initial measles infection. While it is rare, the condition is primarily associated with individuals who had measles during childhood. Since your son is 33 years old and did not receive the measles vaccination, he may not have had measles as a child, which significantly reduces the likelihood of developing SSPE. However, if he were to contract measles now, there is a potential risk for SSPE to develop in the future, typically several years after the infection. It is important to discuss vaccination options and the risks associated with measles with a healthcare provider.","Very few cases are seen in the U.S. since the nationwide measles vaccination program. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally
					occurs in children and adolescents.. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully
					recovered from the illness. Since measles was eliminated in 2000, SSPE is rarely reported in the United States.

					Among people who contracted measles during the resurgence in the United States in 1989 to 1991, 4 to 11 out of every 100,000 were estimated to be at risk for developing SSPE. The risk of developing SSPE may be higher for a person who gets measles before they are two years of age."
"ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.	. My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Tranaunay Syndrome...There is very little information about this. We are looking for the current research and treatments available. She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected. We want to get her help as soon as possible to address
				the symptoms and treat her condition.","Physician: Thank you for reaching out about your granddaughter's condition. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a complex vascular disorder that can lead to various symptoms, including limb overgrowth and vascular malformations. It's great that you're looking for information on current research and treatment options.

For Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, treatment typically focuses on managing symptoms and addressing any complications that arise. This may include:

1. **Symptom Management**: Supportive care is essential. This can involve physical therapy to help with mobility and strength, as well as education on managing symptoms related to her condition.

2. **Vascular Treatments**: Depending on the severity of the vascular malformations, treatments may include sclerotherapy or laser therapy to reduce the appearance of vascular lesions.

3. **Surgical Options**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to correct deformities or improve function, especially if there is significant limb overgrowth.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: It's important to have regular check-ups with a specialist who understands Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome to monitor her condition and adjust treatment as needed.

I recommend consulting with a pediatric vascular specialist or a geneticist who has experience with congenital disorders. They can provide you with the most current research and tailored treatment options for your granddaughter. Additionally, you may want to look into clinical trials that are currently recruiting participants, as they can offer access to new therapies and interventions.

If you have any specific questions or need assistance finding resources, please let me know.","Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.. There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body."

Inherited Ricketts. Mother has inherited ricketts. Passing A child but not B child. How likely would B child pass it on their child?,"To determine the likelihood of child B passing on inherited ricketts to their child, we need to consider the mode of inheritance involved. If the condition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, then child B would have a 50% chance of passing the disorder to their offspring, assuming they inherit the mutant allele from their mother. 

However, if the inheritance is autosomal recessive, child B would need to be a carrier of the disorder (having one copy of the mutant allele) to pass it on. If child B is not a carrier, they would not pass the disorder to their child. 

Since the specifics of the inheritance pattern for ricketts are not provided, it is essential to clarify whether it is autosomal dominant or recessive to give a precise answer. If you have more details about the inheritance pattern, I can provide a more accurate assessment.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.. Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."

Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?. What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C Health Issues and long term prognosis?,"The MTHFR A1298C variant is associated with various health issues, particularly related to folate metabolism and homocysteine levels. Being homozygous for this variant (having two copies of the A1298C allele) may increase the risk of conditions such as hyperhomocysteinemia, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases and other complications.

In terms of long-term prognosis, individuals who are homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant may benefit from monitoring their homocysteine levels and ensuring adequate intake of folate and other B vitamins, as these can help mitigate some of the risks associated with this genetic variant. It's also important to consider lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, which can play a significant role in overall health.

Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider can help manage any potential health issues and provide personalized recommendations based on individual health status and family history. Overall, while being homozygous for the MTHFR A1298C variant may present certain health challenges, proactive management and lifestyle adjustments can lead to a positive long-term prognosis.","MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.. Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Intellectual disability is a serious consequence of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early."
"Vitamin D intake. Can high doses of Vitamin D (50,000 IUs per week) cause flatulence, among other possible effects? And is such a high dose safe to raise very low levels of Vitamin D in the body?","High doses of Vitamin D, such as 50,000 IUs per week, can lead to various side effects, including gastrointestinal issues like flatulence. While Vitamin D is essential for maintaining bone health and regulating calcium levels, excessive intake can lead to toxicity, which may manifest as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and other symptoms. 

Regarding safety, it's crucial to monitor Vitamin D levels closely when taking high doses, especially if you're trying to raise very low levels. It's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and to ensure that it is safe for your specific health situation. Regular blood tests can help assess your Vitamin D levels and guide any necessary adjustments to your supplementation.","Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of
					supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces."
Shingles	. I am looking for information on how to prevent a shingles outbreak.,"To prevent a shingles outbreak, the following strategies can be considered:

1. **Vaccination**: The most effective way to prevent shingles is through vaccination. The shingles vaccine (such as Shingrix) is recommended for adults aged 50 and older, even if they have had shingles before. This vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of developing shingles and its complications.

2. **Boosting Immune System**: Maintaining a healthy immune system can help reduce the risk of shingles. This includes eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, managing stress, and getting adequate sleep.

3. **Avoiding Triggers**: Some individuals may find that certain stressors or illnesses can trigger a shingles outbreak. Identifying and managing these triggers can be beneficial.

4. **Consulting with a Healthcare Provider**: If you have a history of chickenpox or shingles, discussing your risk factors with a healthcare provider can help you understand your options for prevention and whether vaccination is appropriate for you.

By following these preventive measures, you can lower your chances of experiencing a shingles outbreak.","How Can You Reduce Your Risk of Getting Shingles?
					Vaccination is the only way to reduce your risk of shingles and PHN. CDC recommends adults age 60 years or older receive a single dose of shingles vaccine.

CVID	. I have recently been diagnosed with CVID. As a person with thyroid a thyroid tumor greater than 1 cm. and several thyroid cysys I am concerned about cancer. What are the current stats. The tumor is being monitored by my endocrinologist.,"It's understandable to be concerned about your thyroid tumor and cysts, especially with your recent diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). While I cannot provide specific statistics without more context, I can share that thyroid tumors can vary significantly in their potential for malignancy. 

Thyroid tumors greater than 1 cm are typically monitored closely, as they can sometimes be indicative of thyroid cancer, but many are benign. The presence of cysts in the thyroid is also common and often not associated with cancer. 

Your endocrinologist will be the best resource for monitoring your condition and determining the appropriate next steps based on the characteristics of your tumor and cysts. They may recommend regular imaging or biopsies if there are any changes in size or appearance. 

It's important to maintain open communication with your healthcare team about your concerns and any symptoms you may experience. They can provide you with the most accurate information tailored to your specific situation.","1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the

diabete. whats diabete,"Diabetes, or Diabetes Mellitus, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia, which means having abnormally high blood glucose levels, and glucose intolerance. There are different types of diabetes, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2). Type 1 diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency and often occurs suddenly, while Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin resistance and is more common in adults, though it can also occur in children. Managing diabetes typically involves monitoring blood sugar levels and may require medications such as insulin.","Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes."

1. **Consult Your Physician**: Before making any changes to your medication regimen, discuss your plans with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.

2. **Create a Tapering Schedule**: Your physician may recommend a tapering schedule that gradually reduces your dosage over a period of weeks or months. This could involve decreasing the dose by 50 mg every few weeks, depending on your response and any side effects you may experience.

3. **Monitor Symptoms**: As you taper, keep track of any withdrawal symptoms or changes in mood. Common symptoms of antidepressant withdrawal can include anxiety, irritability, and changes in sleep patterns.

4. **Adjust as Needed**: If you experience significant withdrawal symptoms, your physician may suggest slowing down the tapering process or adjusting the dosage further.

5. **Support**: Consider seeking support from mental health professionals or support groups during this process, as tapering off antidepressants can be challenging.

Remember, the goal is to taper off safely and comfortably, so maintaining open communication with your healthcare provider is crucial throughout this process.","1. he tapered off bupropion SR, taking 150 mg/day for 4 days followed by 150 mg every other day for 8 days (4 total doses) and 150 mg every third day for 6 days (2 total doses) without further complications.

"trisomy 7. trisomy 7. i am a 32 y/o who has had 4 miscarriages in the past 19 months. Upon my last DNC two weeks ago revealed a genetics study diagnosis of the baby having trisomy 7. could you offer me any information on this? could this have been maternal or paternal? is this something i would be
				a carrier of? What are the causes? i have tried but haven't found much information","Trisomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality where there is an extra copy of chromosome 7 in the somatic cells. This condition can be associated with various diseases, particularly certain types of thyroid gland adenomas and sporadic breast carcinoma. 

Regarding your situation, the presence of trisomy 7 in your miscarriages could be due to a random error during cell division, which is often the case with chromosomal abnormalities. It is not typically inherited from parents but rather occurs as a sporadic event. However, in some cases, it could be related to maternal age, as advanced maternal age can increase the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancies.

As for whether you could be a carrier, it is unlikely that you would be a carrier of trisomy 7 itself, as it is usually not inherited. However, genetic studies can provide more insight into your specific situation and whether there are any underlying genetic factors that could contribute to recurrent miscarriages.

The causes of trisomy 7 are not fully understood, but it is generally thought to arise from nondisjunction during meiosis, which is when chromosomes fail to separate properly during cell division. This can lead to gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes, which, when fertilized, can result in a zygote with trisomy.

I recommend discussing your concerns with a genetic counselor or a specialist in genetics who can provide more personalized information and guidance based on your medical history and the results of your genetic studies. They can help you understand the implications of trisomy 7 and explore any potential next steps for future pregnancies.","1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe."

intestines digestion and sbsorption. kindly explain the general effects of smoking or rather the effects of nicotine to digestion and arbsoption,"Smoking and nicotine can have several detrimental effects on digestion and absorption in the body. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Reduced Blood Flow**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which can reduce blood flow to the intestines. This decreased circulation can impair the digestive process and hinder the absorption of nutrients.

2. **Altered Gut Motility**: Smoking can affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. It may lead to increased gastric acid secretion and alter the normal rhythmic contractions of the intestines, potentially causing issues such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or constipation.

3. **Impact on Digestive Enzymes**: Nicotine may interfere with the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and other glands, which are essential for breaking down food and facilitating absorption.

4. **Increased Risk of Gastrointestinal Disorders**: Smokers are at a higher risk for developing gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel diseases, which can further complicate digestion and absorption.

5. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Smoking can negatively impact the composition of gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in digestion and nutrient absorption. An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to digestive issues and affect overall health.

6. **Nutrient Absorption**: Smoking has been associated with deficiencies in certain nutrients, such as vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium, due to impaired absorption and increased metabolic demands.

In summary, smoking and nicotine can disrupt the normal processes of digestion and absorption, leading to various gastrointestinal issues and nutrient deficiencies. It is advisable for individuals to consider these effects when evaluating their smoking habits and overall health.","1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa."
sswollen feet ankles legs I have fibromyalgia. When suffering from fibromyalgia will that cause swollen in your body . The swollen started yesterday,"Yes, fibromyalgia can be associated with swelling in the body, although it is not a primary symptom of the condition. The swelling you are experiencing in your feet, ankles, and legs may be related to inflammation or fluid retention, which can occur in some individuals with fibromyalgia. It's important to monitor your symptoms and discuss them with your healthcare provider, as they can help determine the underlying cause of the swelling and recommend appropriate treatment options.","1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids"
"Can cancer spread through blood contact. Sir, after giving an insulin injection to my uncle who is a cancer patient the needle accidentally pined my finger. Is there a problem for me? Plz reply.","It is understandable to be concerned about potential risks after an accidental needle stick injury, especially in the context of a cancer patient. However, cancer itself is not transmitted through blood contact. Malignant neoplasms, which include various types of cancers, do not spread from person to person through blood or bodily fluids.

That said, there is a risk of infection from the needle stick injury itself, particularly if the needle was not sterile. It is important to monitor the site of the injury for any signs of infection and to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and possible preventive measures, such as post-exposure prophylaxis if necessary.

Please ensure you follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss your injury and any appropriate steps you should take.","A healthy person cannot ""catch"" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person."
Plantar Fasiciitis. Is it true that more likely than not that Plantar fasiciitis could be aggravated by a consistancy of weight bearing activities? Are there other forms of aggravation? if so will you please inform me.,"Yes, it is true that plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by a consistency of weight-bearing activities, especially if those activities are not appropriate for your age or physical condition. Engaging in high-impact activities or prolonged standing can increase stress on the plantar fascia, leading to more inflammation and pain.

In addition to weight-bearing activities, other forms of aggravation can include:

1. **Improper Footwear**: Wearing shoes that lack proper support or cushioning can exacerbate the condition.
2. **Overuse**: Increasing the intensity or duration of physical activities too quickly can lead to aggravation.
3. **Biomechanical Issues**: Conditions such as flat feet or high arches can contribute to an imbalance that aggravates plantar fasciitis.
4. **Obesity**: Excess weight can put additional strain on the plantar fascia.
5. **Tight Muscles**: Tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon can also lead to increased tension on the plantar fascia.

It's important to address these factors to help manage and alleviate the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. If you have further questions or need specific recommendations, feel free to ask!","You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:

					Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
					Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces
					Are obese or gain weight suddenly
					Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)
					Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles
					Change your activities"
CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI. CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Yes, lymph nodes and liver cancer can be detected during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) examination. Imaging techniques, such as endoscopy, can help visualize abnormalities in the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Additionally, if there are signs of metastasis or involvement of lymph nodes, imaging can assist in identifying these issues. However, specific diagnostic procedures may be required to confirm the presence of cancer in lymph nodes or the liver.","1. Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

abscess teeth	. Can an abscess teeth cause a heart attack,"Yes, an abscessed tooth can potentially lead to serious complications, including a heart attack. The infection from a dental abscess can enter the bloodstream, leading to bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the blood. This can result in conditions such as endocarditis, an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart, which can damage heart valves and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is important to treat dental infections promptly to prevent such serious health issues.","1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term ""endocarditis"" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection."
ischemic syncope stroke diagonses. define?,"The term ""ischemic syncope stroke diagnosis"" likely refers to a diagnosis related to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) that results in a temporary loss of consciousness due to reduced blood flow to the brain. 

A **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** is characterized by brief, reversible episodes of focal, nonconvulsive ischemic dysfunction of the brain, lasting less than 24 hours, often less than one hour. It is caused by transient thrombotic or embolic occlusion of blood vessels. TIAs are significant as they can be warning signs of future strokes.

On the other hand, a **Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)**, commonly known as a stroke, involves a sudden loss of neurological function due to brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage. This condition can lead to permanent neurological deficits depending on the severity and duration of the ischemia.

In summary, the diagnosis of ischemic syncope in the context of stroke would involve assessing the patient's symptoms, medical history, and possibly conducting imaging studies or other diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the ischemic event and to differentiate it from other conditions.","1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache."

Rheumatologists specialize in treating rheumatic diseases, which often include autoimmune conditions. They are equipped to perform various diagnostic tests related to autoimmune diseases, such as antibody tests and other immunological assessments. If you have specific concerns about your condition, a Rheumatologist would be the appropriate specialist to consult.","Since autoimmune diseases vary greatly in presentation, many different physician specialists care for patients with these disorders. The specialist is usually skilled in treating diseases of a particular system. For example: rheumatologists tend to treat diseases affecting the joints
					and connective tissue; neurologists, autoimmune diseases of the central and/or peripheral nervous system; dermatologists; diseases of the skin; gastroenterologists, diseases of the intestinal tract; and endocrinologists, diseases of endocrine organs. It can be truly said that physicians of any

"General health.  how does effextor cause ED and what is the mimimum amount that causes ED.
				I take effexor. Is there a mimimum amount that will not cause ED","Effexor (venlafaxine) is known to potentially cause erectile dysfunction (ED) as a side effect. This occurs because venlafaxine, as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), can affect neurotransmitter levels that are crucial for sexual function. The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it is believed that increased serotonin levels can inhibit sexual arousal and function.

As for the minimum amount that may cause ED, it can vary significantly from person to person. Some individuals may experience sexual side effects at lower doses, while others may not experience any issues even at higher doses. Generally, doses of venlafaxine start at 37.5 mg and can go up to 300 mg or more, depending on the treatment plan. If you are concerned about ED, it is important to discuss this with your physician, who can help determine the best course of action, which may include adjusting your dosage or considering alternative treatments.","The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225
					mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to
					a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses. Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women."
NSAIDS as a potential cause of ED. How long has this non prescription drug been implicated in erectile dysfunction?,"NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) have been associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) primarily due to their potential side effects, which can include negative impacts on sexual function. While the exact duration of this association is not clearly defined in the literature, it has been recognized for several years that certain medications, including NSAIDs, can contribute to sexual dysfunction in some individuals. The mechanisms may involve alterations in blood flow or hormonal levels, which are crucial for achieving and maintaining an erection. If you have concerns about NSAIDs and their effects on erectile function, it may be beneficial to discuss alternative pain management options with your healthcare provider.","Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for
					indications for NSAID use.

					CONCLUSIONS:
					The modest associations of NSAID use with ED risk in the present cohort were probably attributable to confounding indications for NSAID use. NSAID use was not associated with ED risk."
General health. i want to know more about aeortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by a pathological constriction at the aortic valve, which restricts the outflow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. This can lead to various complications, including heart murmurs, which are often associated with the condition. Aortic stenosis can manifest in different forms, such as supravalvular or subvalvular stenosis, and is often linked to genetic syndromes like Myhre syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome 2.

Patients with aortic stenosis may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or fatigue, particularly during physical activity. Over time, the condition can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy, where the left ventricle enlarges due to the increased pressure it must generate to pump blood through the narrowed valve. This can contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Diagnosis typically involves auscultation to detect characteristic heart murmurs and may include imaging studies to assess the severity of the stenosis. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include monitoring, medication, or surgical interventions such as valve replacement.

If you have specific questions or concerns about aortic stenosis, feel free to ask!","The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart."
What can cause white cells ti uprate,"Leukocytosis, or an increase in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells), can be caused by several factors. Common causes include:

1. **Infection**: The body often responds to infections by increasing white blood cell production to help fight off pathogens.

2. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases or injuries, can lead to an elevated white blood cell count.

3. **Stress**: Biological adaptation to stress, including physical or emotional stress, can also result in leukocytosis.

4. **Allergic Reactions**: An immune response to allergens can trigger an increase in certain types of white blood cells, particularly eosinophils.

5. **Fever**: The presence of fever is often associated with leukocytosis as part of the body's immune response.

6. **Other Medical Conditions**: Various other conditions, such as bone marrow disorders or certain cancers, can also lead to an increase in white blood cell counts.

If you have specific symptoms or concerns, it would be best to discuss them further with your healthcare provider.","A high white blood cell count usually indicates:

					An increased production of white blood cells to fight an infection
					A reaction to a drug that increases white blood cell production
					A disease of bone marrow, causing abnormally high production of white blood cells
					An immune system disorder that increases white blood cell production
					Specific causes of a high white blood cell count include:

					Acute lymphocytic leukemia
					Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
					Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions
					Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
					Chronic myelogenous leukemia
					Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine
					Infections, bacterial or viral
